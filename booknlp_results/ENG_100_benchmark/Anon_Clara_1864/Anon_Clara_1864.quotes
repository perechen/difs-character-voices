771	930	765	765	his	734	" Allow me , Mrs. Vaughan - allow me , my dear sir - to congratulate you cordially . The head is a noble and honest one . It is the growth of the brain that causes these little commotions ; but the congestion will not be permanent . The fits , that have so alarmed you , are at this age a good symptom ; in fact , they are Nature 's remedy . They may last for seven years , or even for ten ; of course they will not depart at once . But the attacks will be milder , and the intervals longer , when she has turned fourteen . For the intellect you need have no fear whatever . Only keep her quiet , and never force her to learn . She must only learn when it comes as it were with the wind . She will never forget what she does learn . "

9723	9836	9720	9720	she	1096	" you will excuse what I am about to say , as I only speak for your good , and from a humble sense that it is the path of duty . It has pleased God , in His infinite wisdom , to afflict your dear mother with a melancholy so sensitive , that she can not bear any allusion to your deeply - lamented father . You have therefore no female guidance upon a subject which justly occupies so much of your thoughts . Your uncle Edgar , in his true affection for you , has thought it right that you should associate more with persons calculated to develop your mind . "

9860	9964	9855	9855	her	1099	" Under these circumstances , it grieves me deeply , my poor dear child , to find you still display a perversity , and a wilful neglect of the blessed means of grace , which must humanly speaking draw down a judgment upon you . Now , open your heart to me , the whole of your little unregenerate heart , you mysterious but I firmly believe not ill - disposed lambkin . Tell me all your thoughts , your broodings , your dreams - in fact , your entire experiences . Uncle Edgar will leave the room , if you wish it . "
9965	9969	9970	9970	I	0	" Certainly not , "
9973	10049	9970	9970	I	0	" Quite right , my dear ; have no secrets from one who has been your second father . Now tell me all your little troubles . Make me your mother - confessor . I take the deepest interest in you . True , I am only a weak and sinful woman , but my chastisements have worked together for my edification , and God has been graciously pleased to grant me peace of mind . "
10050	10061	10062	10062	I	0	" You do n't look as if you had much , "
10109	10248	10106	10106	she	1100	" I have been troubled and chastened severely , but now I perceive that it was all for the best . But perhaps it is not very graceful to remind me of that . Yet , since all my trials have worked together for my good , on that account I am , under Providence , better qualified to advise you , in your dark and perilous state . I have seen much of what thoughtless people call ' life . ' But in helping you , I wish to proceed on higher principles than those of the world . You possess , beyond question , a strong and resolute will , but in your present benighted course it can lead only to misery . Now , what is the principal aim of your life , my love ? "
10249	10258	10106	10106	she	1100	" The death of my father 's murderer . "
10259	10309	10414	10414	she	914	" Exactly so . My unhappy child , I knew it too well . Though a dark sin is your leading star , I feel too painfully my own shortcomings , and old unregenerate tendencies , to refuse you my carnal sympathy . You know my feelings , Edgar . "

10353	10386	10342	10342	She	914	" Now suppose , Clara Vaughan , that , after years of brooding and lonely anguish , you obtain your revenge at last , who will be any the better for it ? "

10393	10408	10414	10414	she	914	" Your father indeed ! How you wrong his sweet and most forgiving nature ! "

10454	10503	10451	10451	I	0	" as I believe it was , never could he forgive that being who tore him from me and my mother . I know that he watches me now , and must be cold and a wanderer , until I have done my duty to him and myself . "
10504	10544	10414	10414	she	914	" You awful child . Why , you 'll frighten us all . But you make it the more my duty . Come with me now , and let me inculcate the doctrines of a higher and holier style . "

14529	14587	14473	14473	he	309	" Now , Clara , you know that I never use curl - papers . My hair does n't want it . You know it 's much prettier than your long waving black stuff , and it curls of its own accord , if mamma only brushes it . But I want to tell you something particular . "

If it 's a good little thing with blue satin arms , and a sash and a slip , and pretty blue eyes that go with a string , perhaps I 'll forgive you , poor child , and set you up with a house , and a tea - set , and a mother - of - pearl perambulator .

15408	15471	15359	15361	this pious tidewaiter	1219	" I hope , my dear , that some day it may be his duty as well as his privilege to advise you . But , of course , you need not take his advice . My Clara loves her own way as much as any girl I ever knew ; and with poor Clement she will be safe to have it . "

Your guardian has thought of that , in effecting this arrangement ; and I trust that I was not wrong in allowing so fair a prospect , under Providence , of your ultimate peace of mind to influence me considerably when he sought my consent .

And your guardian has this arrangement so very much at heart . My own dear child , I have felt for you so long that I love you as a daughter . How thankful I ought to be to the Giver of all good things to have you really my own dear child . "
15704	15731	15479	15479	I	0	" Be thankful , madam , when you have got it . This is a good thing which under Providence you must learn to do without . "

15764	15865	15757	15757	she	1220	" you can not be so foolish and wilful as to throw away this chance of revenge ? If only for your dear mother 's sake , as well as your father 's , it is the path of duty . Let me tell you , both she and yourself are very much more in your guardian 's power than you have any idea . And what would be your poor father 's wish , who has left you so entirely to his brother 's care and discretion ? Will you put off for ever the discovery of his murderer ? "

17530	17552	17510	17510	she	1263	" Your use , my poor child , of the possessive pronoun is far more emphatic than your good breeding is . "
17553	17560	17510	17510	she	1263	" Who cares for your opinion ? "
17604	17627	17577	17577	she	1263	" Poor creature ! It is a rebuke to me , for my want of true faith in the efficacy of prayer . "

19073	19128	19070	19070	he	1310	" you are an odd girl , and a Vaughan all over . I would rather be your friend than your enemy . If you can not like me , at least forget your dislike of me , and remember that I am your uncle , and have tried to make you love me . "
19129	19137	19178	19178	he	1311	" And what if I do not ? "
19138	19176	19178	19178	he	1311	" Then I must keep you awhile from the management of this property . My dear brother would have wished it , until you recover your senses ; and not an acre of it is legally yours . "
19261	19269	19270	19270	I	0	" Will the property pass to you ? "
19273	19289	19270	19270	I	0	" Yes , if I choose : or at any rate the bulk of it . "
19290	19306	19216	19216	I	0	" What part will be yours ? Do you mean to say the house ? - "
19307	19329	19270	19270	I	0	" Never mind now . I would rather leave things as they are , if you will only be more sensible . "
19330	19361	19270	19270	I	0	" I will not disguise my opinions for a hundred Vaughan Parks , or a thousand Vaughan Palaces ; no , nor even to be near my father 's bones . "
19362	19366	19367	19367	he	1313	" Very well , "
19370	19391	19367	19367	he	1313	" just as you like . But for your mother 's sake , I give you till Christmas to consider . "
19392	19410	19270	19270	I	0	" If you bring back Mrs. Daldy , I shall leave the door as she enters it . "
19411	19420	19421	19421	he	1313	" I have no wish to hurry you , "
19424	19480	19421	19421	he	1313	" and therefore she shall not return at present . Now take these papers with you . You may lay them before any lawyer you please . They are only copies , but may be compared with the originals , which I have . They will quickly prove how totally you are at my discretion . "
19481	19521	19522	19522	He	1313	" The money and the land may be so , but not I. Before I go , answer me one question . Did you know of these things , whatever they may be , before my father 's death ? "
19544	19555	19522	19522	He	1313	" No . As a gentleman , I did not . "

21440	21445	21446	21446	he	1384	" Well , miss , "
21453	21475	21446	21446	he	1384	" I knew you could n't do it , because I seemed , somehow , it was n't like a Vaughan . "
21956	21977	21978	21978	He	914	" Seven years ago , at this very moment , my father was killed . Do you know this dagger ? "
21999	22006	22007	22007	I	0	" You know it , then ? "
22018	22027	22007	22007	I	0	" It was your hand that used it . "
22064	22067	22068	22068	he	914	" Yes , "
22071	22085	22068	22068	he	914	" I have seen that weapon before . Alas my poor dear brother ! "
22117	22124	22125	22125	I	0	" You know who owned it ? "
22135	22164	22125	22125	I	0	" Yes . I know who owned it once ; but many years ago . And I know not in the least what is become of him now . "
22630	22639	22640	22640	he	914	" Your mother shall have a home here , "
22643	22798	22640	22640	he	914	" as long as ever she wants one ; but as for you , malignant or mad , I will try no more to soften you . When first I saw you in your early childhood , you flew at me as a murderer . Soon after you ransacked my cupboards and stole my boots , to compare them with some impressions or casts you kept . Yes , you look astonished . I never told you of it , but I knew it for all that . Of those absurdities I thought little , for I regarded them as the follies of a mad child , and I pitied you deeply , and even liked you for your filial devotion . But now I find that you have grown up in the same belief , and you dare even now to avow it . You know that I have no fear of you . "
22799	22808	22812	22812	he	1409	" Then why had you got that pistol ? "
22823	22865	22812	22812	he	1409	" In a house like this , where such deeds have been done , I think it right to be armed . Do you think if I had feared you , or your evidence , I would have restored that dagger ? "
22866	22871	22640	22640	he	914	" Whose was it ? "
22872	22905	22640	22640	he	914	" I told you the other night that I once saw a weapon like it , for which at first I mistook it , but closer examination convinced me of the difference . "
22906	22912	22640	22640	he	914	" How does it differ ? "
22913	22937	22640	22640	he	914	" In this . There was no snake on the handle of the other , though there was the cross on the blade . "
22938	22947	22640	22640	he	914	" And where did you see the other ? "
22948	22965	22640	22640	he	914	" Some day I will tell you . It is not right to do so now . "
22966	22977	22640	22640	he	914	" Not convenient to you , I suppose you mean . "
22978	23085	23086	23086	He	1410	" I have also shown you that the lock of hair found in your poor mother 's hand is much finer and more silky than mine ; and you know that I can not draw on my foot a boot so small as the one whose impression you have . But I am ashamed of myself for having stooped to such proofs as these . Dare you to look at me and suppose that I with my own hand could have stabbed my brother , a brother so kind and good to me , and for whose sake alone I have borne so long with you ? "
23111	23125	23105	23105	he	1410	" So , you doubt me still ? Are your things packed ? ' "
23133	23134	23105	23105	he	1410	" "
23158	23159	23151	23151	you	0	" "
23162	23166	23151	23151	you	0	" I replied , "
23174	23175	23151	23151	you	0	" "
23199	23221	23225	23225	criminals	1416	" He put in my hand an order for a large sum of money . I threw it into the fire . "
23227	23231	23225	23225	criminals	1416	" I exclaimed , "
23273	23274	23266	23266	we	1414	" "
23292	23293	23280	23280	You	0	" "
23379	23380	23364	23364	You	0	" "
23392	24162	23386	23386	My	0	" God has much to forgive me , but nothing worse than the dark thought of that speech . In my fury at weakness in such a cause , I had dared sometimes to imagine that my mother knew him to be the murderer , but concealed it for the sake of the family honour ! CHAPTER XII . No need to recount my bitter farewell to all the scenes and objects I had loved so long , to all which possessed a dark yet tender interest , and most of all to my father 's grave . That some attention might still be paid to this , I entrusted it to the care of an old housekeeper of ours , who was living in the village . My last visit was in the moonlight , and dear mother was there . I carried rather than led her away . Slight as my knowledge has been of lightsome and happy love , I am sure that a sombre affection is far the stronger and sweeter . As we began our journey , a crowd of the villagers met us beyond the lodge , and lined the Gloucester road as far as the old oak - tree . While our hired conveyance passed between them , the men stood mute with their hats in their hands , the women sobbed and curtseyed , and blessed us , and held up their children to look at us . Our refuge was the small estate or farm in Devonshire , which I have mentioned as my mother 's property . This , which produced L45 a - year , was all that now remained to us , except a sum of L1,000 left to me by a godfather , and of which I could not touch the principal . The residue of the personalty , and the balance at the banker 's , we had refused to take , being assured that legally we were responsible to Mr. Vaughan , even for the back rents of the Gloucestershire estate . Of course we had plenty of jewellery , some of it rather valuable , but the part most precious was heirloom , and that we had left behind . Most of our own had been my father 's gift , and therefore we could not bear to sell it . As regarded myself , this comparative poverty was not of very great moment , except as impairing my means of search ; but for my mother 's sake I was cut to the heart , and lost in perplexity . She had so long been accustomed to much attention and many luxuries , which her weak health had made indispensable to her . Thomas Henwood and poor Ann Maples insisted on following our fortunes , at one third of their previous wages . My mother thought it beyond our means to keep them even so ; but for her sake I resolved to try . I need not say that I carried all my relics , difficult as it was to hide them from my mother . When we reached our new home , late in the evening of the second day , a full sense of our privation for the first time broke upon us . It was mid - winter , and in the gloom of a foggy night , and after the weariness of a long journey , our impressions were truly dismal . Jolted endlessly up and down by ruts a foot deep and slaty stones the size of coal - scuttles , entombed alive betwixt grisly hedges which met above us like the wings of night , then obliged to walk up treadmill hills while the rickety fly crawled up behind ; then again plunging and lurching down some corkscrew steep to the perpetual wood and rushing stream at the bottom ; at length and at last along a lane so narrow that it scraped us on both sides as we passed , a lane which zig - zagged every thirty yards with a tree - bole jutting at every corner , at length and at last we came to the farmyard gate . It was not far from the lonely village of Trentisoe , which lies some six miles to the west of Lynmouth . This part is little known to London tourists , though it possesses scenery of a rarer kind than Lynmouth itself can show . Passing through an outer court , with a saw - pit on one side and what they call a "
24164	24176	23364	23364	You	0	" on the other , and where a slop of straw and "
24178	24199	23364	23364	You	0	" quelched under the wheels , we came next to the farmyard proper , and so as the flyman expressed it "
24204	24206	23364	23364	You	0	" The "
24208	24311	23364	23364	You	0	" was a low straggling cottage , jag - thatched , and heavy - eaved , and reminded me strongly of ragged wet horse - cloths on a rack . The farmer was not come home from Ilfracombe market , but his wife , Mrs. Honor Huxtable , soon appeared in the porch , with a bucket in one hand and a candle stuck in a turnip in the other . In the cross - lights , we saw a stout short woman , brisk and comely , with an amazing cap , and cheeks like the apples which they call in Devonshire "
24315	24316	23364	23364	You	0	" "
24324	24331	23364	23364	You	0	" she called into the house , "
24385	24398	24377	24377	gie	1425	" Having thus provided for our horse , she advanced to us . "
24434	24598	24599	24600	Poor leddy	1427	" So saying , she hurried us into the house , and set us before a wood - fire all glowing upon the ground , beneath an enormous chimney podded with great pots and crocks hung on things like saws . These pots , like Devonshire hospitality , were always boiling and chirping . The kitchen was low , and floored with lime and sand , which was worn into pits such as boys use for marbles ; but the great feature was the ceiling . This was divided by deep rafters into four compartments lengthwise . Across some of these , battens of wood were nailed , forming a series of racks , wherein reposed at least a stye - ful of bacon . Herbs and stores of many kinds , and ropes of onions dangled between . Mrs. Huxtable went to the dresser , and got a large dish , and then turned round to have a good look at us . "
24602	24607	24608	24608	I	0	" she said gently , "
24657	24664	24667	24667	Miss	1430	" Then she turned to me . "
24680	24681	24684	24685	Mrs. Huxtable	337	" "
24697	24698	24691	24691	I	0	" "
24732	24761	24712	24712	Us	1428	" Her chattering warmth soon put us at our ease ; and as soon as the parlour fire burnt up , she showed us with many apologies , and "
24765	25252	25277	25277	Varmer	339	" the room which was thenceforth to be ours . After tea , I put my dear mother to bed as soon as possible , and sat by the dying fire to muse upon our prospects . Not the strangeness of the place , the new ideas around me , not even my weariness after railroad , coach , and chaise , could keep my mind from its one subject . In fact , its colour had now become its form . To others indeed , all hope of ever detecting and bringing to justice the man , for whose death I lived , might seem to grow fainter and fainter . Expelled from that place , and banished from those recollections , where , and by which alone , I could well expect ever to wind up my clue , robbed of all means of moving indifferent persons and retaining strong ones ; and , more than this , engrossed as I must henceforth be in keeping debt at bay , and shielding my mother from care - what prospect was there , nay what possibility , that I a weak unaided girl , led only by set will and fatalism , should ever overtake and grasp a man of craft , and power , and desperation ? It mattered not : let other things be doubtful , unlikely , or impossible ; let the hands of men be clenched against me , and the ears of heaven be stopped ; let the earth be spread with thick darkness , as the waters are spread with earth , and the murderer set Sahara between us , or turn hermit on the Andes ; happen what would , so God were still above us , and the world beneath our feet - I was as sure that I should send that man from the one to the throne of the other , as he was sure to be dragged away thence , to fire , and chains , and gnashing of teeth . CHAPTER XIII . So impulsive , kind - hearted , and honest was Mrs. Huxtable , that we could always tell what was the next thing she was going to say or do . Even at her meals she contrived to be in a bustle , except on Sundays ; but she got through a great deal of work . On Sundays she put on , with her best gown , an air of calm dignity which made her unhappy until it was off , which it was directly after the evening service . She seemed a very sensible woman , and whatever the merits of the case she sided always with the weakest . The next morning we asked how it was she appeared not to expect us , as I had written and posted the letter myself on the previous Saturday . "
25257	25261	25277	25277	Varmer	339	" she replied , "
25329	25336	25338	25338	her	1433	" - and off she ran - "
25356	25393	25344	25345	Miss Clerer	341	" So they had only a general idea that we were coming , and knew not when it would be . The following day , Thomas Henwood arrived , bringing our boxes in a vehicle called a "
25396	25456	25457	25457	Death	342	" which is a short and rudely made cart , used chiefly for carrying lime . After unpacking our few embellishments , we set up a clumsy but comfortable sofa for my mother , and tried to divert her sadness a little by many a shift and device to garnish our narrow realm . We removed the horrible print of "
25462	25580	25583	25584	Miss Clerer	341	" which was hung above the chimneypiece , and sundry daubs of our Lord and the Apostles , and a woman of Samaria with a French parasol , and Eli falling from a turnpike gate over the Great Western steamer . But these alterations were not made without some wistful glances from poor Mrs. Huxtable . At last , when I began to nail up a simple sketch of the church at Vaughan St. Mary instead of a noble representation of the Prodigal Son , wearing a white hat with a pipe stuck under the riband , and weeping into a handkerchief with some horse upon it , the good dame could no longer repress her feelings . "
25692	26014	26046	26046	Miss	1445	" To argue with such a connoisseur would have been worse than useless ; so I pacified her by hanging the rejected gems in her own little summer room by the dairy . Our parlour began before long to look neat and even comfortable . Of course the furniture was rough , but I care not much for upholstery , and am quite rude of French polish . My only fear was lest the damp from the lime - ash floor should strike to my dear mother 's feet , through the scanty drugget which covered it . The fire - place was bright and quaint , lined with old Dutch tiles , and the grey - washed walls were less offensive to the eye than would have been a paper chosen by good Mrs. Huxtable . The pretty lattice window , budding even now with woodbine , and impudent to the winds with myrtle , would have made amends for the meanest room in England . Before it lay a simple garden with sparry walks and bright - thatched hives , and down a dingle rich with trees and a crystal stream , it caught a glimpse of the Bristol Channel . CHAPTER XIV . When our things were nearly settled , and I was sitting by myself , with dirty hands and covered with dust , there came a little timid tap at the door , followed by a shuffling outside , as if some one contemplated flight , yet feared to fly . Opening the door , I was surprised to find the child whom I expected a massive figure , some six feet and a quarter high , and I know not how many feet in width , but wide enough to fill the entire passage . He made a doubtful step in advance , till his great open - hearted face hung sheepishly above my head . "
26024	26028	26021	26022	Mr. Huxtable	344	" I asked . "
26033	26044	26046	26046	Miss	1445	" he stammered , blushing like a beet - root , "
26144	26145	26143	26143	Miss.	1446	" "
26166	26170	26143	26143	Miss.	1446	" This was an "
26173	26189	26143	26143	Miss.	1446	" but audible a long way off , as they always are on the stage . "
26207	26208	26209	26209	I	0	" "
26262	26267	26255	26255	her	1451	" This also was an "
26270	26271	26255	26255	her	1451	" "
26275	26279	26280	26280	I	0	" I said , "
26295	26296	26291	26292	my mother	749	" "
26311	26344	26308	26308	my	0	" he asked with the truest and finest smile I ever saw : and I felt ashamed in front of the strong simplicity which took my conventional words for heart 's truth . "
26351	26354	26308	26308	my	0	" he continued "
26383	26414	26372	26373	a loi	1456	" And thereupon he took my puny weak hand in his rough iron palm , like an almond in the nut - crackers , and examined it with pitying wonder . "
26499	26500	26496	26497	' un	1461	" "
26511	26530	26508	26509	Mr. Huxtable	344	" He took some time to meditate upon this , and shook his head when he had finished . "
26627	26874	26875	26877	Poor dear leddy	1467	" Before I could thank him for his honest championship my mother entered the room , and all his bashfulness lost for the moment in the pride of strength came over him again like an extinguisher . Although he did not tremble - his nerves were too firm for that - he stood fumbling with his hat , and reddening , and looking vaguely about , at a loss where to put his eyes or anything else . My mother , quite worn out with her morning 's walk , surprised at her uncouth visitor , and frightened perhaps at his bulk , sank on our new - fangled sofa , in a stupor of weakness . Then it was strange and fine to see the strong man 's sense of her feeble state . All his embarrassment vanished at once ; he saw there was something to do ; and a look of deep interest quickened his great blue eyes . Poising his heavy frame with the lightness of a bird , he stepped to her side as if the floor had been holy , and , scarcely touching her , contrived to arrange the rude cushions , and to lay her delicate head in an easy position , as a nurse composes a child . All the while , his looks and manner expressed so much feeling and gentleness , that he must have known what it was to lose a daughter or mother . "
26879	26885	26886	26886	her	1467	" he whispered to me , "
26916	26917	26896	26896	I	0	" "
26944	26962	26929	26929	I	0	" I could n't help crying a little ; and I could n't help his seeing it . "
27109	27132	27076	27076	ye'll	1468	" With this homely comfort he departed , after a cheering glance at my mother . Before I proceed , the Homeric epithet "
27139	27193	27076	27076	ye'll	1468	" applied by the poet to Mr. Huxtable , needs some explanation . It appears that the farmer , in some convivial hour for at other times he detested vaunting , had laid a wager that he and Timothy Badcock , his farm - labourer , would plough half an acre of land , "
27201	27264	27076	27076	ye'll	1468	" Now , it happened that the Parracombe blacksmith had lately been at Barnstaple , and there had seen a man who had heard of ploughing by steam . So when the farmer 's undertaking got noised abroad and magnified , all Exmoor assembled to witness the exploit , wondering , trembling , and wrathful . Benches and tables were set in the "
27268	27352	27076	27076	ye'll	1468	" a nice piece of mealy land , just at the back of the house , while Suke and Mrs. Huxtable plied the cider - barrel for the yeomen of the neighbourhood . The farmer himself was not visible - no plough or ploughing tackle of any description appeared , and a rumour began to spread that the whole affair was a hoax , and the contriver afraid to show himself . But as people began to talk of ' sending for the constable "
27521	27530	27532	27534	stout Tim Badcock	351	" Gee wugg now , if e wull , "

28232	28252	28095	28096	The farmer	5501	" and that the passage down which we quilty is , correctly speaking , not the throat , but the "
28255	28263	28095	28096	The farmer	5501	" a strange - looking individual darkened the "
28265	28273	28124	28124	she	1502	" corruptly called the threshold and crossed the "
28276	28569	28124	28124	she	1502	" or floor , to the fireplace where we sat . Turning round , I beheld a man about fifty years old , of moderate stature , gauntly bodied , and loosely built , and utterly reckless of his attire . His face was long and thin , the profile keenly aquiline ; and the angles made yet sharper , by a continual twitching and tension of the muscles . The skin of his cheeks was drawn , from his solemn brows to his lipless and down - curved mouth , tight and hollow , like the bladder on a jam - pot . His eyes , of a very pale blue , seemed always to stand on tip - toe , and never to know what he was going to say . A long , straight , melancholy chin , grisly with patches of hair , was meant by nature to keep his mouth shut , and came back sullenly when it failed . Over his shoulders was flung a patched potato - sack , fastened in front with a wooden skewer , and his nether clothes were as ragged as poetry . In his air and manner , self - satisfaction strove hard with solemn reserve . Upon the whole he reminded me of an owl who has lost his heart to a bantam hen . I can not express him justly ; but those who have seen may recognise Beany Dawe , the sawyer , acknowledged the bard of the north of Devon . Mr. Ebenezer Dawe , without any hesitation or salute , took a three - legged stool , and set it between our chairs , then looked from Mrs. Huxtable to me , and introduced himself . "

28765	28811	28756	28756	Pote	361	" The subject of these elegant strictures regarded her all the time , with that pleased pity which none but a great Poet so placed can feel . Then swinging slowly on his tripod , and addressing the back of the chimney , he responded : "
28832	28851	28829	28830	a hunderzawyer	1511	" Perhaps his lofty couplet charmed her savage ear ; at any rate she made a peaceful overture . "
28865	28876	28855	28856	Mr. Dawe	340	" He assented with an alacrity much below his dignity ; "

29411	29458	29484	29484	he	340	" These words he repeated with impressive earnestness , shaking his head and sighing , as if in deprecation of so sad a remedy . Yet the subject possessed perhaps a melancholy charm , and his voice relented to a pensive unctuousness , as he concluded . "
29511	29512	29513	29513	Thee	0	" "
29526	29531	29522	29522	I	0	" said the farmer , "
29541	29552	29553	29553	Wull	358	" Scorning this vile insinuation , Mr. Dawe continued thus : "
29663	29674	29675	29675	Wull	358	" Here he paused , overcome by his own description . "
29677	29694	29695	29695	Wull	358	" said the farmer , brightening with fellow - feeling , for he liked his glass , "

29777	29896	29771	29775	the very sa - am	1524	" he repeated with an extrametrical smack of his lips , which he wiped with the back of his hand , and cast a meaning glance towards the cellar . The farmer rose , and took from the dresser a heavy quart cup made of pewter . With this he went to the cellar , whence issued presently a trickling and frothing sound , which thrilled to the sensitive heart of Mr. Dawe . The tankard of ale , with a crown of white foam , was presented to the thirsty bard by his host , who did not , however , relinquish his grasp upon the vessel ; but imposed like Pluto to Orpheus a stern condition . "
29919	29995	29909	29909	thee	340	" At this barbarous restriction , poor Ebenezer rolled his eyes in a most tragic manner ; he thrust his tongue into his cheek , and swung himself , not to and fro as usual , but sideways , and clutched one hand on the tatters of his sack , while he clung with the other to the handle of the cup . Then with a great effort , and very slowly , he spoke - "

30053	30056	30049	30049	he	0	" down . "

32137	32503	32103	32103	she	749	" She opened her arms , and held me in a nervous cold embrace , and thanked God , and wept . CHAPTER XVII . When the surgeon came , he pronounced that none of her limbs were broken , but that the shock to the brain , and the whole system , had been so severe , that the only chance of recovery consisted in perfect quiet . She herself said that the question was , whether Providence wanted her still to watch over her child . After some days she came down stairs , not without my support , and was propped once more upon her poor sofa . Calm she appeared , and contented , and happy in such sort as of old ; but whenever she turned her glance from me , she observed with starting eyes every little thing that moved . Especially she would lie and gaze through the open window , at a certain large spider , who worked very hard among the woodbine blossoms . One day , in making too bold a cast , he fell ; some chord of remembrance was touched , and she swooned away on the couch . In spite of these symptoms I fondly hoped that she was recovering strength . She even walked out with me twice , in the sunny afternoon . But this only lasted a very short time ; it soon became manifest , even to me , that ere long she would be with my father . Unable to fight any more with this dark perception , I embraced it with a sort of savage despair , an utter sinking of the heart , which defied God as it sank . This she soon discovered , and I fear that it saddened her end . She was much disappointed , too , that we could not find or thank him who had perilled his life for us . None could tell who he was , or what had become of him ; though the farmer , at our entreaty , searched all the villages round . We were told , indeed , by the landlady of the "
32508	32610	32103	32103	she	749	" a lonely public - house near the scene of the accident that a stranger had come to her in very great haste , and , having learned who we were , for she had seen us pass half an hour before , had sent her boy to the farm for some kind of conveyance , while he returned at full speed to attend those whom he had rescued . It further appeared that this stranger had helped to place us in the cart , and showed the kindest anxiety to lessen the roughness of its motion , himself even leading old "
32613	32702	32103	32103	she	749	" to thwart his propensity to the deepest and hardest ruts . By the time our slow vehicle reached the farm , Mrs. Huxtable was returned from the Lower Cleve orchard , where she had been smoking the fernwebs , in ignorance of our mishap ; and our conductor , seeing us safe in her hands , departed without a word , while she was too flurried and frightened to take much notice of him . Neither could the woman of the inn describe him ; she was so "
32705	32711	32103	32103	she	749	" when she heard of the "
32719	32741	32748	32748	he	1610	" as she called our slide of about fifty feet ; and for this she quoted the stranger as her authority , "
32751	33662	32748	32748	he	1610	" though , just before this , she had stated that he was a foreigner and could not speak English . Knowing that in Devonshire any stranger is called a foreigner , and English means the brogue of the countryside , I did not attach much weight to this declaration . The only remaining witness , the lad who had come with the butt , was too stupid to describe anything , except three round O 's , with his mouth and eyes . But it mattered little about description ; I had seen that stranger under such circumstances , that I could not fail to know him again . On the morrow , and once in the following week , some kind inquiries were made as to our condition , by means of slips of paper conveyed by country lads . No name was attached to these , and no information given about the inquirer . The bearer of the first missive came from Lynmouth , and of the second from Ilfracombe . Neither lad knew anything though submitted by Mrs. Huxtable to keen cross - examination , except that he was paid for his errand , but would like some cider , and that the answer was to be written upon the paper he brought . Whether any motive for concealment existed , beside an excess of delicacy , or whether there even was any intentional secresy , or merely indifference to our gratitude , was more than we could pretend to say . I am not at all inquisitive - not more so , I mean , than other women - but I need not confess that my curiosity to say nothing of better feelings was piqued a little by this uncommon reserve . So now , beside the engrossing search for my deadly enemy , I had to seek out another , my brave and noble friend . CHAPTER XVIII . But for the present , curiosity , gratitude , hate , all feelings indeed and passions , except from the bled vein of love , and the heart - rooted fibres of sorrow , were to be crushed within me . Evening after evening , my dear mother 's presence seemed more and more dreamy and shadowy ; and night after night she went feebler and feebler to bed . In the morning indeed she had gathered some fragile strength , such strength as so wasted a form could exert , and the breeze and the fresh May sun made believe of health on her cheeks . But no more was I tempted to lay my arm round her waist , and rally her on its delicate girlish span , nor could I now look gaily into her eyes , and tell her how much she excelled her child . Those little liberties , which with less than a matron 's dignity , and more than a mother 's fondness she had so long allowed me , became as she still expected , and I could not bear to take them , so many great distresses . Even at night , when I twined in its simple mode her soft brown hair , as I thought how few the times my old task would be needed again , it cost me many a shift to prevent her descrying my tears in the glass , or suspecting them in my voice . For herself , she knew well what was coming ; she had learned how soon she must be my sweet angel instead of my mother , and her last trouble was that she could not bring me to think the difference small . So calmly she spoke of her end , not looking at me the while for fear we both should weep , so gently and sweetly she talked of the time when I should hearken no more , as if she were going to visit a garden and hand me the flowers outside . Then , if I broke forth in an anguish of sobs , she would beg my forgiveness , as if she could have done wrong , and mourn for my loneliness after her , as though she could help forsaking me . Looking back , even now , on that time , how I condemn and yet pardon myself , reflecting how little I tried to dissemble my child - like woe . When all things rejoiced in their young summer strength , and scarcely the breeze turned the leaves for the songs of the birds , and the pure white hawthorn was calm as the death of the good , and the soul of gladness was sad , we talked for the last time together , mother and child , looking forth on the farewell of sunset . The room under the thatch smelled musty in summer , and I had made up a bed on the sofa downstairs . The wasting low fever was past , and the wearisome cough exhausted , and the flush had ebbed from her cheeks as the world from her heart , and of all human passions , and wishes , and cares , not one left a trace in her bosom , except a mother 's love . This and only this retarded her flight to heaven , as the sight of his nest delays the rising of the lark . "
33666	33680	32748	32748	he	1610	" she began , and her voice was low , but very distinct , "
33738	33825	33826	33826	I	0	" - here she fairly broke down , in spite of religion , and heaven , and turned her head to the pillow , a true daughter and mother of earth . I would fain have given that fortune , whose loss to me she lamented , for leave to cry freely with her , without adding to her distress . In a minute or two , she was able to proceed ; with her thin hand she parted the hair shaken purposely over my eyes . "
33908	33947	33974	33974	my	0	" Her voice began to tremble , and her eyes became fixed , and I feared a return of the old disorder ; but she shook it off , and spoke again distinctly , though with great labour : "
34067	34068	34040	34040	your	1618	" "
34079	34087	34040	34040	your	1618	" I cried in my selfish loneliness ; "
34095	34096	34040	34040	your	1618	" "
34115	34116	34109	34109	you	1618	" "
34126	34137	34117	34117	Mother	298	" neither did I , while she could see me . "
34144	34148	34117	34117	Mother	298	" she said , "
34162	34163	34200	34200	mother	742	" "
34168	34172	34200	34200	mother	742	" I replied , "
34181	34199	34200	34200	mother	742	" I saw that I had grieved her . How could I call her then anything else than "
34201	34203	34204	34205	My mother	749	" ? "
34228	34264	34222	34222	him	1629	" She bowed her head , with a look I can not describe . In the harsh way I had put it , it seemed as if she were injuring both my father and me . "
34368	34385	34347	34347	I	0	" Her face in its sadness and purity made me bury my eyes and forget things . "
34403	34458	34459	34459	Mother	742	" The depth of her last agony , and which I believed would cling to her even in heaven , was more than I could bear . I knelt on the floor and put my hand to her side . Her worn out heart was throbbing again , with the pang of her disappointment . "
34461	34465	34459	34459	Mother	742	" I cried , "
34548	34549	34550	34550	Clara	300	" "
34552	34567	34568	34568	you	300	" she answered weakly , and she spoke more slowly and feebly every time , "
34631	34673	34675	34679	the God of the fatherless	1647	" I put my finger upon her pale lips . How could she tell such a story then ? Her tears came now and then , and would not be stopped , as she laid her weak hand on my head . "
34721	34909	34923	34923	him	1654	" A sudden happiness fell upon her , as if she had seen her prayer 's acceptance . She let her arms fall round me , and laid my cheek by the side of her bright flowing smile . It was the last conscious stir of the mind ; all the rest seemed the flush of the soul . In the window the night - scented heath was blooming ; outside it , the jessamine crossed in a milky way of white stars , and the lush honeysuckle had flung down her lap in clusters . The fragrance of flowers lay heavy upon us , and we were sore weary with the burden of sorrow and joy . So tranquil and kind was the face of death , that sleep , his half - brother , still held his hand . The voice of the thrush , from the corner laurel , broke the holy stillness . Like dreams of home that break our slumbers , his melody was its own excuse . My mother awoke , and said faintly , with no gleam in her eyes : "
34951	34968	34934	34934	I	0	" I lifted her gently . The voice of nature made way for her passing spirit . "
35002	35048	34997	34997	you	1653	" She clasped her hands in prayer , with one of mine between them . My other was round her neck . Then she spoke slowly , and with a waning voice ; but firmly , as if it had been her marriage - response . "
35077	35153	35074	35074	my	0	" The bird went home to his nest , and she to that refuge where all is home . Though the hands that held mine grew cold as ice , and her lips replied to no kiss , and the smile on her face slept off into stillness , and a grey shade crept on her features ; - I could not believe that all this was death . CLARA VAUGHAN BOOK II . CHAPTER I. "
35159	35448	35074	35074	my	0	" some poet says . How well I know and feel it ! the gloom before him deepening as he comes , and the world of darkness stretching many years behind . I once dared to believe that no earthly blow could ever subdue , or even bend my resolute will . I now found my mistake , and cared not even to think about it . On the morning after my mother 's death I wandered about , and could not tell where to go . The passionate clinging which would not allow me , during that blank and sleepless night , to quit what remained of her presence , and the jealous despair which felt it a wrong that any one else should approach , had now settled down to a languid heaviness , and all that I cared for was to be let alone . All the places where we had been together I visited now , without knowing why , perhaps it was to see if she were there . Then vaguely disappointed , I thought there must be some mistake , and wearily went the dreary round again . I can not clearly call to mind , but think it must have been that day , when I was in the corner of the room , looking at the place whence they had taken dear mother . Ann Maples and Mrs. Huxtable came in , followed by the farmer , who had left his shoes at the door . They did not see me , so I suppose it must have been in the evening . They were come to remove the sofa . I have not the heart to follow their brogue . "
35454	35484	35074	35074	my	0	" said Mrs. Huxtable , looking at it with a short sigh . It was odd that it should strike me then , but all she did was short . "
35495	35500	35492	35493	poor dear	1662	" said Ann Maples . "
35510	35517	35492	35493	poor dear	1662	" exclaimed the farmer 's wife . "
35527	35532	35492	35493	poor dear	1662	" returned the other . "

35619	35640	35641	35642	All children	1668	" asked my nurse . Mrs. Huxtable was about to answer sharply , but checked herself , and only said : "

35659	35682	35641	35642	All children	1668	" cried Ann Maples , who had never had any . The farmer came between them , walking on tip - toe . "

35717	35722	35714	35715	any folks	1671	" asked Mrs. Huxtable , "

35748	35753	35746	35746	ma'am	1626	" continued her antagonist . "

36195	36202	36217	36217	I	0	" replied the farmer , sadly , "
36220	36233	36217	36217	I	0	" he dropped his voice , but added , after some reflection , "

36263	36283	36260	36260	thee	1693	" Mrs. Huxtable was disappointed that the case would not be argued . The farmer discreetly changed the subject . "

The moment they touched it I burst forth from my corner , and flung myself upon it , rolling as if I would bury myself in the ecstasy of anguish . What they did I can not tell ; they might say what they liked , I had not cried till then . The next day I was sitting stupified and heavy , trying once more to meet the necessity of thinking about my mother 's funeral ; but again and again , the weakness of sorrow fell away from the subject . The people of the house kept from me . Mrs. Huxtable had done her best , but they knew I would rather be alone . The door was opened quietly , and some one entered in a stealthy manner . Regarding it as an intrusion , I would not look that way . "
36569	36581	36565	36566	Miss Clara	300	" began the farmer , standing behind me , and whispering , "

36803	36838	36800	36801	Miss Vaughan	300	" Poor fellow ! he knew nothing of irony , as we do , who are born to good taste , otherwise I might have suspected him of it then . He suddenly wished me "
36842	36885	36800	36801	Miss Vaughan	300	" although it was middle - day , and then he made off for the door , but came back again with a desperate resolve , and spoke , for him , very quickly , looking all the time at his feet . "
36936	37035	37036	37037	Mr. Huxtable	344	" He opened his great hand , which was actually shaking , and hurriedly placed on the sofa a small packet tied in the leaf of a copy book ; then suddenly put in mind of something , he made a dive , and snatching it up , flung it upon a Windsor chair . It fell with a chink , the string slipped off , and out rolled at least forty sovereigns and guineas , and a number of crown - pieces . Peremptorily I called him back , for he was running out of the door . "
37046	37047	37036	37037	Mr. Huxtable	344	" "
37169	37197	37166	37167	Beany Dawe	340	" He repeated his rhyme , with some relief , hoping to change the subject . I caught him by both hands , and burst into tears . "
37203	37214	37166	37167	Beany Dawe	340	" he said , with a thickness in his voice , "
37230	37231	37166	37167	Beany Dawe	340	" "
37239	37243	37234	37234	me	0	" I sobbed , "
37257	37919	37920	37920	Nancy	301	" Though I longed to look him in the face , I knew that I must not do so . Oh why are men so ashamed of manly tears ? Perceiving that I could not speak , he began to talk for both of us , making a hundred blundering apologies , trying to hide his knowledge of my poverty , and to prove that he was only paying a debt which extended over many years of tenancy . He was not at all an imaginative man , but delicacy supplied him with invention . So deep a sense pervades all classes in this English country , that want of money is an indictment , which none but the culprit may sign . Poor or rich , I should not be worth despising , if I had shown the paltry pride of declining such a loan . The tears came anew to my eyes when I found that what had been brought so freely was the savings of years of honest toil , a truth which the owners had tried to conceal by polishing the old coin . But not being skilled , dear souls , in plate - cleaning , they had left some rotten - stone adhering to the George and Dragons . CHAPTER II . Although I find a sad pleasure in lingering over these times , with such a history still impending , I can not afford the indulgence . Dear mother 's simple funeral took me once more to my native place . Even without Mr. Huxtable 's generous and noble assistance , I should have laid her to rest by the side of the husband she loved so well . But difficulties , sore to encounter at such a time , would have met me on every side . Moreover the kind act cheered and led me through despondency , like the hand and face of God . Caring little what people might say or think , I could not stay at a distance . Nature told me that it was my duty to go , and duty or not , I could not stay away . And now for the last time I look on the face and form of my mother . That which I have played , and talked , and laughed with , though lately not much of laughter , that which has fed and cared for me , till it needed my care in turn ; that which I have toddled beside , or proudly run in front of ; whose arms have been round me whenever I wept , and whose bosom the haven of childhood 's storms ; first to greet me with smiles in the morning , and last to bless me with tears at night ; ever loving , and never complaining - in one word for a thousand , my mother . So far away now , so hopelessly far away ! There it lies indeed , I can touch it , kiss it , and embrace it ; but oh how small a part of mother ! and even that part is not mine . So holy and calm it lies , such loving kindness still upon its features , so near me , but in mystery so hopelessly far away ! I can see it , but it never will know me again ; I may die beside it , and it can not weep . The last last look of all on earth - they must have carried me away . I remember tottering down the hill , supported by a stalwart arm . The approach to the house prevented - or something . Two children ran before me , stopping now and then to wonder , and straggling to pick hedge - flowers . One of them brought me a bunch , then stared , and was afraid to offer them . "
37930	38535	38536	38536	Clara	300	" whispered a woman 's voice . The little girl shrunk to me for shelter , with timid tears in her great blue eyes . So I took her hand , and led her on , and somehow it did me good . At intervals , the funeral hymn , which they sing on the road to the grave , fell solemnly on our ears . Some one from time to time gave out the words of a verse and then it was sung to a simple impressive tune . That ancient hymn , which has drowned so many sobs , I did not hear , but felt it . We arrived at Vaughan St. Mary late in the afternoon of the second day . The whole of the journey was to me a long and tearful dream . Mr. Huxtable came with us . He had never before been further from home than Exeter ; and his single visit to that city had formed the landmark of his life . He never tried to comfort me as the others did . The ignorant man knew better . Alone I sat by my father 's grave , with my mother 's ready before my feet . They had cast the mould on the other side , so as not to move my father 's coverlet . The poor old pensioner had been true to her promise , and man 's last garden was blooming like his first flower - bed . My mind if any I had seemed to have undergone some change . Defiance , and pride , and savage delight in misery , were entirely gone ; and depression had taken the place of dejection . Death now seemed to me the usual and proper condition of things , and I felt it an impertinence that I should still be alive . So I waited , with heavy composure , till she should be brought , who so often had walked there with me . At length she was coming for good and all , and a space was left for me . But I must not repose there yet ; I had still my task before me . The bell was tolling faster , and the shadows growing longer , and the children who had been playing at hide - and - seek , where soon themselves shall be sought in vain , had flitted away from sight , perhaps scared at my presence , perhaps gone home to tea , to enjoy the funeral afterwards . The evening wind had ceased from troubling the yews , and the short - lived songs of the birds were done . The place was as sad as I could wish . The smell of new earth inspired , as it always does , some unsearchable everlasting sympathy between the material and the creature . The sun was setting behind me : suddenly a shadow eclipsed my own upon the red loam across the open grave . Without a start , and dreamily as I did all things now , I turned to see whence it came . Within a yard of me stood Mr. Edgar Vaughan . In a moment the old feeling was at my heart , and my wits were all awake . I observed that he was paler than when I had seen him last , and the rigid look was wavering on his face , like steel reflected by water . He lifted his hat to me . I neither rose nor spoke , but turned and watched him . "
38538	38548	38536	38536	Clara	300	" he said in a low , earnest voice , "
38586	38617	38690	38690	he	1716	" I heard , with some surprise , his allusion to the Great Being , whom he was not wo nt to recognise ; but I made him no reply . "
38621	38688	38690	38690	he	1716	" he resumed , with the ancient chill hardening over his features ; ' so then let it be . I am not come to offer you condolence , which you would despise ; nor do I mean to be present when you would account the sight of me an insult . And yet I loved your mother , Clara ; I loved her very truly . "
38712	38721	38709	38709	he	1716	" Would you know who killed your father ? "
38722	38729	38730	38730	I	0	" And my mother , too , "
38733	38740	38730	38730	I	0	" whose coffin I see coming . "

39265	39290	39225	39225	we	1739	" The one who slain your brother is at 19 Grove Street London . You will come in danger of it why you know . "
39426	39434	39478	39478	they	1745	" Daddy ! Daddy 's come home ! "
39735	39738	39724	39725	one man	1757	" Sir , "

40493	40496	40497	40497	I	0	" Sir , "
40506	40521	40502	40502	he	1768	" Sir , I will detain you no longer from murdering that poor stag . "
40527	40544	40522	40522	He	1768	" I am not of the Devonshire hunters , who toil to exterminate this noble race . "
40828	40843	40820	40820	I	0	" Dear me , Mrs. Huxtable , how they will admire these in London . "
40844	40850	40851	40851	she	337	" In Lonnon , cheel ! "

40923	40938	40966	40966	she	749	" Oh yes , they will . I shall be there in a week . "
40939	40957	40958	40958	She	749	" In Lonnon in a wake ! Dear heart alaive , cheel , dont'e tell on so ! "
41003	41041	40990	40990	I	0	" Yes , dear Mrs. Huxtable , I must leave my quiet home , where all of you have been so good and kind to me ; and I have already written to take lodgings in London . "

42893	42918	42633	42633	Tim	351	" I have never been in London , Tim , since I was a child ; and I know nothing at all about wrestling . "
42919	43075	42633	42633	Tim	351	" Wull , Miss , that be nayther here nor there . But there had been a dale of brag after Maister had thrown arl they Carnishers to Barnstable vair , last year , about vetching this here Tom Gundry , who wor the best man in Cornwall , to throw our Maister . Howsomever , it be time for ai to crack on a bit . ' Ah , ' zays the man avoot , who zimth had coom to back un , ' ah , ' twor arl mighty faine for Uxtable to play skittles with our zecond rate men .

43093	43568	43087	43088	Mrs. Huxtable	337	" ' Coom now , ' my maister zaith , trying to look smarl behaind the fuzz , ' thee must throw me , my lad , avore thee can throw Jan Uxtable .

43757	43762	43764	43764	Tim	351	" Wor it though ? "
43766	43817	43764	43764	Tim	351	" thee knows better nor that , Missus . It be the beggest hadge on arl the varm , wi ' a double row of saplin hash atap . Her maks the boundary betwixt the two parishes , and ai n't been trimmed these vaive year , ai can swear . "
43818	43841	43844	43844	Miss	5418	" And how be the both on 'em now , Tim ? A must have gone haigh enough to channge the mune . "
43846	43864	43844	43844	Miss	5418	" said Tim , addressing me , for he had told his Mistress all the story twice , "
44038	44039	44040	44040	Tim	351	" "
44042	44047	44040	44040	Tim	351	" said Mrs. Huxtable , "
44112	44113	44108	44108	thee	351	" "
44116	44133	44108	44108	thee	351	" said Tim , favouring me with a wink , in the excess of his glory , "
44154	44201	44135	44135	they	1818	" Every word of Tim 's story is true , except as regards the names . CHAPTER VI . Two or three days after this , I was keeping school in the dairy , the parlour being too small for that purpose , and the kitchen and "
44205	44343	44135	44135	they	1818	" as they called the back - kitchen too open to inroads from Suke and Tim . My class consisted of ten , or rather was eight strong , the two weames big baby and little baby , only attending for the sake of example , and because they would have roared , if parted from the other children . So those two were allowed to spraddle on the floor , where sometimes they made little rollers of themselves , with much indecorum , and between whiles sat gravely sucking their fat red fingers , and then pointed them in a glistening state at me or my audience , and giggled with a large contempt . The eight , who made believe to learn something , were the six elder Huxtables , and two of Tim Badcock 's "
44347	44419	44135	44135	they	1818	" I marshalled them , four on each side , against the low lime - whitened walls , which bore the pans of cream and milk . Little Sally , my head scholar , was very proud of measuring her height , by the horizontal line on the milk - pan where the glazing ended ; which Tabitha Badcock , even on tiptoe , could not reach . They were all well "
44422	44634	44135	44135	they	1818	" and had white pinnies on , and their ruddy cheeks rubbed up to the highest possible polish , with yellow soap and the jack - towel behind the wash - up door . Hence , I never could relieve them from the idea that Sunday now came every day in the week . I maintained strict discipline , and allowed no nonsense ; but two sad drawbacks constantly perplexed me . In the first place , their ways were so ridiculous , and they laboured so much harder to make me laugh , than they did to learn , that I could not always keep my countenance , and when the spelling - book went up before my face , they knew , as well as possible , what was going on behind it , and peeped round or below , and burst out all together . The second drawback was , that Mrs. Huxtable , in spite of all my protests , would be always rushing in , upon errands purely fictitious ; and the farmer himself always found some special business in the yard , close to the wired and unglazed window , whence every now and then his loud haw - haws , and too audible soliloquies , "

45279	45545	45264	45264	she	405	" so the mail is bribed with a pint of cider , while I write to secure a new home . My departure being now fixed and inevitable , the women naturally began to remonstrate more than over . It had been settled that Ann Maples should go with me , not to continue as my servant , but to find a place for herself in London . My few arrangements , which cost me far more pain than trouble , were not long in making ; and after saying good - bye to all the dear little children and weanies , and kissing their pretty faces in their little beds , amid an agony of tears from Sally , I was surprised , on entering the kitchen , to find there Mr. Beany Dawe . There was little time for talking , and much less for poetry . We were to start at three in the morning , the farmer having promised to drive us to meet the coach in Barnstaple , whence there would be more than thirty miles of hilly road to Tiverton , the nearest railway station . The journey to London could thus be made in a day , though no one in the parish could be brought to believe it . The poet had been suborned , no doubt , by Mrs. Huxtable , and now detained me to listen to an elegy upon the metropolis of England . I can not stop to repeat it , neither does it deserve the trouble ; but it began thus : - "
45712	45713	45714	45714	Lor	407	" "
45716	45721	45714	45714	Lor	407	" cried Mrs. Huxtable , "
45751	46263	45743	45743	Them	1841	" When , with remarkable patience , I had heard out his elegant effusion , the author , who had conceived much good will towards me , because I listened to his lays and called him Mr. Dawe , the author dived with a deep - drawn sigh into a hole in his sack , and produced in a mysterious manner something wrapped in greasy silver paper , and well tied up . He begged me to accept , and carry it about me most carefully and secretly , as long as I should live . To no other person in the world would he have given this , but I had earned it , as a true lover of poetry , and required it as a castaway among the perils of London . In vain I declined the present ; refusal only confirmed his resolution . As the matter was of so little importance , I soon yielded upon condition that I should first examine the gift . He gave me leave with much reluctance , and I was surprised at the beauty and novelty of the thing . It was about the size of a Geneva watch , but rather thicker , jet black and shining , and of the exact shape of a human heart . Around the edge ran a moulding line or cord of brilliant red , of the same material as the rest . In the centre was a white spot like a siphuncle . What it was I could not guess , but it looked like some mineral substance . Where the two lobes met , a small hole had been drilled to receive a narrow riband . After putting me through many guesses , Mr. Dawe informed me that it was a pixie 's heart , a charm of unequalled power against witchcraft and assassination , and to enthral the affection of a loved one . He only smiled , and rubbed his nose , on hearing that I should never want it in the last capacity . Being greatly pleased with it , I asked him many questions , which he was very loth to answer . Nevertheless I extorted from him nearly all he knew . As he was sawing into boards a very large oak - tree , something fell from the very heart of it almost into his mouth , for poor Ebenezer was only an undersawyer . As he could not stop the saw without his partners concurrence , and did not wish to share his prize , he kicked some sawdust over it until he could stoop to pick it up unobserved . In all his long experience of the woods , he had seen but two of these rare and beautiful things , and now assured me that any sawyer was considered lucky who found only one in the course of his career . The legend on the subject was rather quaint and graceful , and deserves a better garb than he or I can furnish . "

One vein of sympathy between us was opened at once , by her coming into the room with a lame blackbird on her finger ; and I was quite surprised at the number of her pets . As for the ' splendid apartments , "
49162	49325	49328	49328	you	1937	" were very old , and not over clean , until I scoured them , and the drawing - room as my landlady loved to call it was low and small , and looked through the rails of a narrow balcony upon a cheese - monger 's shop across the road instead of a wooded dingle , I was very well satisfied with them ; and above all the rent was within my means . In the afternoon , when things were growing tidy , a carriage drove up rapidly , and a violent ringing of the bell ensued . It was Lady Cranberry , who , under the pretext of bringing Ann Maples home , was come to gratify her own sweet curiosity . She ran upstairs in her most charming manner , caught me by both hands , and would have kissed me desperately , if I had shown any tendency that way . Then she stopped to admire me . "
49353	49374	49375	49375	I	0	" Of course I was pleased with her admiration ; but only for a moment , because I disliked her . "

I almost choked when she spoke in that way of my father , utterly as I despised her . But I made it a trial of self - control , which might be demanded against more worthy objects . "

Mrs. Shelfer had been in raptures at having so grand a vehicle and two great footmen at her door . Lest the street should lose the effect , she had run in and out a dozen times , and banged the door , and got into talk with the coachman , and sent for beer to the Inn , though she had it in the house . She now came again to my door , in what she called a "
50032	50107	49905	49906	Mrs. Shelfer	405	" I could not attend to her , but locked myself in , and wrestled with my passionate nature , at one time indulging , then spurning and freezing it . Yet I could not master it , as I fancied I had done . CHAPTER IX . Soon afterwards , Ann Maples went to the place which she had obtained in Lady Cranberry 's household ; and I determined to begin my search . "
50117	50211	49905	49906	Mrs. Shelfer	405	" My landlady was feeding her birds , and I had made up for her disappointment about Lady Cranberry , by fitting the lame blackbird with a wooden leg , cut from a skewer , and tipped with a button : it was pretty to see how kindly and cleverly he took to it , and how proudly he contemplated it , when he thought there was no one watching . His mistress now stopped her work , and made ready for a long speech , with the usual snap of her lips . "

It was the first time I walked all alone in London , and though we lived quite in the suburbs it seemed very odd to me . For a while I felt rather nervous , but no one molested me then or at any other time ; although I have heard some plain young ladies declare that they could not walk in London without attracting unpleasant attention . Perhaps because they knew not the way either to walk or to dress . Without any trouble , I found No . 19 , Grove Street , then rang the bell and looked round me . It was a clean unpretentious street , not to be known by its architecture from a thousand others in London . The bell was answered by a neat little girl , and I asked for the Master of the house . Clever tactics truly for commencing a task like mine . Being told that the Master was from home , I begged to see the Mistress . The little maid hesitated awhile , with the chain of the door in her hand , and then invited me into the parlour , a small room , but neat and pretty . "

52192	52234	52106	52106	I	0	" For a while I hesitated . But it seemed so great a point to know who the writer was , that I hushed my hesitation . However , I showed the letter so that she could not gather its import . "

52595	53243	53246	53247	good dog	2037	" As this clue , which seemed so promising , led to nothing at all , I may as well wind it up at once , and not tangle my story with it . Mr. Elton permitted his wife to tell me all she knew about the Polish exiles , for they were gone to America , and nothing done here could harm them . But at the same time he made me promise not to mention to the police , if my case should ever come before them , the particulars which he gave me ; and I am sure he would not wish me to make free with the gentleman 's name . A gentleman he was , as both my kind friends assured me , and not likely to conceal any atrocious secret , unless he had learned it in a way which laid it upon his honour . Mr. Elton had never been intimate with him , and knew not who his friends were , but Mrs. Elton had liked the lady who was very kind and passionate . Also she was very apt to make mistakes in English names , and to become confused at moments of excitement . Therefore Mrs. Elton thought that she had confounded the Eltons ' address with that of some other person ; for it seemed a most unlikely thing that she should know the residents at two Nos . 19 Grove Street . However so it proved - but of that in its place . It was now six months since they had quitted London , perhaps on account of the climate , for the gentleman had been ill some time , and quite confined to the house . It would be altogether vain to think of tracing them in America . While living in London they owned a most magnificent dog , a truly noble fellow but afflicted with a tumour . This dog suddenly disappeared , and they would not tell what had become of him , but the lady cried most violently one day when he was spoken of . Directly after this they left the country , with a very brief farewell . All this I learned from Mr. and Mrs. Elton during my second visit , for Mrs. Elton was too good a wife to dispense with her husband 's judgment . Also I saw their daughter , a pleasing delicate girl ; they learned of course some parts of my story , and were most kind and affectionate to me ; and I am proud to have preserved their friendship to the present time . But as they take no prominent share in the drama of my life , henceforth they will not be presented upon its stage . As I returned up the Villa Road , thinking of all I had heard , and feeling down at heart , something cold was gently placed in my ungloved hand . Turning in surprise and fright I saw an enormous dog , wagging his tail , and looking at me with magnificent brown eyes . Those great brown eyes were begging clearly for the honour of my acquaintance , and that huge muzzle was deposited as a gage of love . As I stooped to ascertain his sentiments , he gravely raised one mighty paw and offered it to me delicately , with a little sigh of self - approval . Upon my accepting it frankly and begging to congratulate him upon his noble appearance and evident moral excellence , he put out his tongue , a brilliant red one , and gave me a serious kiss . Then he shrugged his shoulders and looked with patient contempt at a nicely - dressed young lady , who was exerting her lungs at a silver whistle some fifty yards down the road . "
53249	53256	53246	53247	good dog	2037	" I said with a smile , "
53271	53272	53265	53266	your Mistress	2038	" "
53277	53284	53274	53274	her	2038	" he said with his eyes , "
53318	53357	53309	53309	you	2039	" And with that he resumed a long bone , laid aside while he chatted to me , tucked it lengthwise in his mouth , like a tobacco - pipe , and after shaking hands again , and saying "
53364	53537	53309	53309	you	2039	" the great dog trotted away sedately , flourishing his tail on high , like a plume of Pampas grass . At the corner of the railings he overtook his young Mistress , whose features I could not descry ; though from her air and walk I knew that she must be a pretty girl . A good - tempered one too she seemed to be , for she only shook her little whip lightly at the dog , who made an excursion across the road and sniffed at a heap of dust . CHAPTER X. Although Ann Maples was not so very talkative , it would be romantic to suppose that Mrs. Shelfer had failed to learn my entire history , so far at least as her cousin knew it . Having now disposed of one Grove Street , I was about to try the same rude tactics with another , viz . that in Hackney ; when my landlady gave a little nervous knock , and hurried into the room . "

54362	54392	54355	54355	Patty	421	" Away she went , smoothing her apron , patting the fray of her hair - for she never wore side - combs - and mumbling down the stairs . "
54413	54694	54403	54403	I	0	" She brought up my dinner and tea , without a single word , but with many sly glances at me from her quick grey eyes . Once or twice she was at the point of speaking , and the dry smile she always spoke with fluttered upon her face ; but she closed her lips firmly and even bit them to keep herself in . I could scarcely help laughing , for I liked the odd little thing ; but she was so free with her tongue , that the lesson was sadly wanted . Late in the evening , she came to say that Inspector Cutting was there , and would come up if I wished it . Upon my request he came , and one look was enough to show that his niece had not misdescribed him . An elderly man , but active looking and wiry , with nothing remarkable in his features , except the clear cast of his forehead and the firm set of his mouth . But the quick intelligence that shot from his eyes made it seem waste of time to finish telling him anything . For this reason , polite though he was , it became unpleasant to talk to him . It was something like shooting at divers - as my father used to describe it - for whom the flash of the gun is enough . Yet he never once stopped or hurried me , until my tale was done , and all my thoughts laid bare . Then he asked to see all my relics and vestiges of the deed ; even my gordit did not escape him . "
54696	54701	54703	54703	you	2069	" he said shortly , "
54708	54719	54703	54703	you	2069	" I can read it , but not speak it . "
54720	54738	54703	54703	you	2069	" Is it commoner for Italian surnames to begin with an O , or with a C ? "
54739	54755	54703	54703	you	2069	" There are plenty beginning with both ; but more I should think with a C. "
54789	54830	54785	54785	his	2070	" Allow me , young lady , to put a few questions to you , on matters you have not mentioned . Forgive me , if they pain you . I believe you feel that they will not be impertinent . "
54838	54847	54831	54831	I	0	" What was your mother 's personal appearance ? "
54848	54854	54703	54703	you	2069	" Most winning and delicate . "
54855	54867	54785	54785	his	2070	" How old was she at the time of her marriage ? "
54868	54876	54831	54831	I	0	" Twenty - one , I believe . "
54877	54885	54703	54703	you	2069	" How old was your father then ? "
54886	54891	54785	54785	his	2070	" Twenty - five . "
54892	54900	54831	54831	I	0	" How many years were they married ? "
54901	54906	54831	54831	I	0	" Sixteen , exactly . "
54907	54916	54703	54703	you	2069	" When did your guardian first leave England ? "
54917	54930	54831	54831	I	0	" In the course of a year or two after the marriage . "
54931	54943	54831	54831	I	0	" Had there been any misunderstanding between him and your father ? "
54944	54953	54703	54703	you	2069	" None , that I ever heard of . "
54954	54968	54703	54703	you	2069	" Did your father , at any time , travel on the continent ? "
54969	54984	54831	54831	I	0	" Only in Switzerland , and part of Italy , during his wedding tour . "
54985	54998	54703	54703	you	2069	" Your guardian returned , I believe , at intervals to England ? "
55006	55024	54703	54703	you	2069	" Yes . At least I suppose so , or he would not have been in London . "
55025	55034	54831	54831	I	0	" Did he visit then at Vaughan Park ? "
55035	55042	54831	54831	I	0	" Not once within my memory . "
55043	55096	54831	54831	I	0	" Thank you . I will ask no more . It is a strange story ; but I have known several much more strange . Of one thing be assured . I shall catch the criminal . I need not tell you that I heard much of this case at the time . "
55097	55105	54831	54831	I	0	" Were you sent down to Gloucestershire ? "
55106	55144	54831	54831	I	0	" No . If I had been - well , I will not say . But I was not then in my present position . Had I been so , it would have become my special department . "
55145	55160	54831	54831	I	0	" Pray keep me no more in suspense . Tell me what you think . "
55161	55196	54831	54831	I	0	" That I must not do , or you should know it at once , for my opinion is formed . It would be a breach of duty for me to tell you now . "
55197	55200	55201	55201	I	0	" Oh , "
55207	55216	55201	55201	I	0	" I wish I had never seen you . "
55217	55267	54831	54831	I	0	" Young lady , you have done your duty in placing the matter before me , and some day you will rejoice that you did so . One piece of advice I will give you : change your name immediately , before even the tradesmen about here know it . "
55268	55286	54831	54831	I	0	" Change my name , Inspector Cutting ! Do you think I am ashamed of my name ? "
55287	55359	55201	55201	I	0	" Certainly not . You have shown great intelligence when a mere child ; exert but a little now , and you will see the good sense , or rather the necessity , of my recommendation . When you have gained your object , you may resume your name with pride . You have given your information , Miss Vaughan , as clearly as ever I knew a female give it . "
55378	55381	54831	54831	I	0	" female . "
55387	55420	55383	55383	I	0	" Inspector Cutting , I thank you for the compliment . It would be strange indeed if I could not tell with precision , what I have thought of all my life . "
55421	55468	55469	55469	He	2072	" Excuse me , Miss , it would not be strange at all , in a female . And now I will wish you ' good night . ' You shall hear from me when needful . Meanwhile , I will take charge of these articles . "
55491	55497	55498	55498	I	0	" Indeed you wo n't , "
55501	55516	55517	55517	He	2072	" you shall not have one of them . What are you thinking of ? "
55557	55560	55550	55550	He	2072	" Now , "
55566	55583	55561	55561	I	0	" you can not take those away , unless you dare to outrage a young lady . "
55783	55791	55792	55792	he	424	" All right , old ' ooman , "
55822	55901	55792	55792	he	424	" And with that he disappeared , and I had time to pity myself . The hand the poor farmer used so to admire , and which I was proud of no doubt , in my way , lay in a dishcloth covered and oozing with blood . But my relics were on the table , all safe . A quick step was heard on the stairs , and Inspector Cutting came in , carrying a small phial . "
55909	55913	55792	55792	he	424	" he cried , "
55922	55944	55792	55792	he	424	" He took up a basin of cold water , and poured half the contents of the little phial into it . "
55965	56003	55959	55959	I	0	" My hand was put into the water , and the bleeding was stanched in a minute or two . However he kept it there for a quarter of an hour , till it was quite benumbed . "
56057	56122	56123	56124	Inspector Cutting	423	" I looked at my hand , and found three parallel gashes across it , for every edge of the weapon was keen . But only one wound was deep , viz . that across the palm , which was very deep under the thumb . I have the mark of it still . All the wounds were edged with a narrow yellow line . "
56126	56130	56123	56124	Inspector Cutting	423	" I cried , "
56170	56192	56193	56194	Miss Vaughan	422	" The last word seemed to move him . They all like big words , however clear - headed they are . "
56226	56227	56221	56221	you	423	" "
56237	56238	56221	56221	you	423	" "
56321	56373	56374	56374	I	0	" I did so with all my heart . I liked him much better since I had defeated him ; and I saw that it was well worth the pain , for he would do his utmost to make amends . He wished me good night with a most respectful bow . "
56418	56419	56402	56403	No doctor	2079	" "
56448	56838	56427	56427	you	422	" Inspector Cutting would have formed a far lower opinion of my spirit , if he had seen how I cried that night ; not from the pain of the wounds , I am sure , but to think of the fuss dear mother would have made about them . CHAPTER XI . In spite of the arnica , my cuts were not healed for a month ; not enough , I mean , for me to handle a pencil . Mr. Cutting , when he came , according to promise , told me something to quiet me , because I was so feverish . Whether he believed it , or only acted medically , was more than I could decide . The opinion he gave me , or the substance of it , was this . That the deed was done , not for money , or worldly advantage in any way , but for revenge . Here I thought of Mrs. Daldy . What wrong the revenge was wreaked for , he could not even guess , or at any rate would not hint to me . That the straightest clue to the mystery was to be sought in Italy , where my guardian 's track should be followed carefully . The idea of forcing , or worming , the truth from him was rejected at once through my description of his character ; although the Inspector quite agreed with me , that , even if guiltless of the crime , Mr. Edgar Vaughan knew all about it now . That no importance should be attached to the anonymous letter from London ; in accordance with my promise to Mrs. Elton , I did not mention the Polish lady 's name ; and Mr. Cutting did not press me to do so , for he firmly believed from what I said that she had made a mistake in the address she gave , and would not help us now , even if we could find her . That nevertheless a strict watch should be kept in London , whither flock nine - tenths of the foreigners who ever set foot in this country . London moreover was likely , ere long , to draw nearly all the migratory strangers to the business or pleasure of next year 's "
56842	56996	56997	56997	Valentine	304	" provided only that it should prove successful , as the Inspector thought it would . As for my enemy being attracted by works of industry , it seemed to me quite against nature that a base assassin should care for art or science , or any national progress . But the remembrance of several cases , among the dark annals I used to delight in , soon proved to me my error ; while the long experience of a man , versed from his youth in criminal ways , convicted me of presumption . To put myself more on a level with fraud , and stealth , and mystery , I did a thing for which I felt guilty to myself and my mother . I changed my name . But , in spite of Inspector Cutting , I did not travel out of the family . My father 's second name was "
56999	57015	56997	56997	Valentine	304	" taken from his mother . This name I assumed in a shorter form , becoming "
57019	57120	57016	57017	Clara Valence	428	" it saved change of initials and a world of trouble , and I felt warmer in it , because it seemed to have been my father 's . In the neighbourhood I knew no one except Mrs. Elton , to whom as I grew intimate with her I partly explained my reasons . As for Mrs. Shelfer , she was delighted at the change . She said that her Uncle John had christened me , that it sounded much prettier , and would always remind her of Valentines . Nevertheless I longed for the day when I might call myself "
57123	57264	57121	57122	Clara Vaughan	300	" once more . By the time I was able to go about freely again and use my hand as of old , it was the middle of November . The first use I made of my pencil was to copy most carefully all that Inspector Cutting required . He promised to keep these drawings , and indeed the whole matter , most jealously to himself ; by which term he meant , as I afterwards found , Inspector Cutting and those to whom he was bound to report . What I now wanted was money , to send an adroit inquirer throughout the North of Italy , and other parts where my guardian 's shifting abode had been . I knew that he dwelt awhile at Pisa , Genoa , and Milan , also at an obscure little village named "
57267	57301	57121	57122	Clara Vaughan	300	" which I could not find in the maps . All I had learned of his rovings was from the lessons my father would give me sometimes , when he used to say , "
57313	57840	57310	57311	Uncle Edgar	317	" To every one , but myself , it seemed a strange thing that after so many wanderings , Mr. Edgar Vaughan had brought no valet , major domo , or courier , no dependant or retainer of any kind , and not even a foreign friend to England , or at any rate to Vaughan Park . But now for the needful resources - the only chance of procuring them lay in my young and partly self - tutored art . I braced myself with the remembrance , that while none of my family ever laid claim to genius , the limner 's faculty had never been wanting among them . Inferior gifts are often as heirlooms in the blood , though high original power follows no vein except its own . The latter none of us ever possessed ; but taste and the knack of adaptation had seldom been alienated . Observation too , in a small way , and the love of nature seemed inborn in us all . My father 's drawings were perfect , but for the one thing wanted ; and in sketches from outdoor nature that want was less perceived . My grandfather had been known among the few amateurs of the day as a skilful colourist . As to habits of observation , a little tale handed down in our family will show that they had existed in one of its members seven generations ago . In the autumn of 1651 , when King Charles was stealing along from Colonel Wyndham 's house to the coast of Hampshire and Sussex , the little band was overtaken by nightfall , somewhere near the New Forest . It was shortly after the narrow escape of the King from that observant blacksmith , who saw that his horse was shod with North - country iron . Though he was taking it easily , his three trusty friends knew well that a Roundhead Squadron was near , and that his last chance depended on speed and night travel . What could they do now in the tempestuous darkness ? They were in a tract thinly inhabited , half woodland , half heather , and the road was hopelessly lost . No rain fell as yet it was true , and the wind was waiting for rain , but the lightning came fitfully from the horizon all round . The King alone was on horseback , his three companions afoot . They stood still in doubt and terror , for they could not tell north from south . Suddenly Major Cecil Vaughan espied a faint gleam familiar to him of old in the waste land round Vaughan Park . To an accurate eye there could be little doubt as to the source of the lambent light - flame it could not be called . It played in a pale yet constant stream on a certain kind of moss , known to botanists , not to me , for the waste lands have been reclaimed . This light is to be seen at no time , except when the air is surcharged with electricity . "
57850	57858	57845	57845	I	0	" cried Major Vaughan , right cheerily . "
57866	57871	57864	57864	man	1548	" said the King , "
57879	58349	57877	57877	dashers	2084	" What this meant , I used as a child to wonder ; but now I know . For six dark miles the Major led them without default , until they came to a lonely heathman 's house , where they slept in safety . He never told them how he did it ; being apt , I suppose , as men of the second order are , to hug superior knowledge . But it was a most simple thing . That strangely sensitive moss follows the course of the sun , and therefore the lambent light can only be seen from the west . So all the time he could see it - the others never saw it at all - he knew that they were wending from west to east , which was their proper course . To return to myself . I put the finishing touch to a view of rock and woodland scenery , north - west of Tossil 's Barton , and set off to try my fortune with it . Some young ladies , born to my position , would have thought this errand one of much degradation , but it did not appear so to me . So I walked briskly - for I hate an omnibus , and could ill afford a cab - to the shop of a well - known dealer in pictures , not far from the Haymarket . It was my first venture into the heart of London , but I found the way very easily , having jotted it down from a map . The day was dark and drizzly ; the pavement grimy and slimy , and hillocked with mud at the joints of the flags . It was like walking on a peeled kneading - trough with dollops of paste left in it . Along the far reach of the streets , and the gardens in the squares , wisps of fog were crawling , and almost every one was coughing . The dealer received me politely . Too politely in fact : for it seemed to savour of kindness , which I did not want from him . What I wanted was business , and nothing else . He took my poor drawing , done only in water - colours , and set it up in a square place made perhaps for the purpose , where the brown flaw fell upon it from a skylight formed like a Devonshire chimney . Then he drew back and clasped his hands , then shaded his eyes with them , as if the light were too strong , whereas the whole place was like a well turned upside down . He seemed uneasy because I did not care to follow him throughout all this little performance . "
58353	58399	57877	57877	dashers	2084	" I said , for my foolish pride was up , and I spoke as I would have done to the porter at our lodge , not with the least contempt - I was never so low as that - but with a long perspective , "
58419	58420	58413	58413	you	434	" "
58530	58531	58535	58536	Mr. Oxgall	434	" "
58538	58539	58535	58536	Mr. Oxgall	434	" "

58588	58603	58585	58586	Miss Valence	435	" I said , with an emphasis that startled him out of his mincing . "
58638	58639	58641	58641	you	435	" "
58679	58697	58698	58699	Miss Valence	435	" I went up many steps in his opinion , by reason of my curtness and independence . "
58717	58718	58698	58699	Miss Valence	435	" "
58725	58751	58698	58699	Miss Valence	435	" said I in pure simplicity . I went up several steps more . How utterly men of the world are puzzled by plain truth ! "
58805	58806	58796	58796	you	435	" "
58821	58822	58813	58813	I	0	" "
58907	58908	58910	58910	you	435	" "

58977	58978	58972	58973	an artist	2093	" "
58990	58991	58980	58980	you	435	" "
59059	59438	59051	59051	I	0	" He took from a desk three new sovereigns and three new shillings , wrapped them neatly in silver paper , and handed them to me . I never imagined I could be so proud of money . Light of heart I left the shop , not that I had made my fortune yet , but what was greater happiness , I thought myself likely to make it . Soon I perceived , with some alarm , how thick and murky the air had grown . The fog was stooping heavily down , and was now become like a wash of gamboge and lamp - black . All the street - lamps were lit , though they could not see one another , and every shop - keeper had his little jet . The pavement was no longer slippery , but sticky and dry ; and a cold , that pierced to the bones , was stealing along . Already it had begun to freeze ; and I , so familiar both with white and black frost , observed with no small interest the grey or fog - frost , which was new to me . How different from the pure whiteness when the stars are sparkling , and the earth is gleaming , and the spirit of man so buoyant ! This grey fog - frost is rather depressing to most natures , and a chilly damp creeps to the core of all things . Thick encrusting rime comes with it , and sometimes a freezing rain . Before I reached the New Road , the fog had grown so dense and dark , that I was much inclined to take a cab , for fear of losing my way . But I could not see one , and finding myself at last in a main thoroughfare called the Hampstead Road , I walked on briskly and bravely till I reached Camden Town , when I knew what course to pursue . Slowly wending up College Street , for I was getting tired and the fog thicker than ever , indeed every step seemed a thrust into an ochred wall , I heard a plaintive , and rather musical , voice chanting , much as follows : - "
59701	59702	59686	59686	Georgiana	436	" "
59707	59830	59831	59832	Sweet lady	2121	" I said : I could just see her through the fog . She looked like one who had seen better days , and the thought of my own vicissitudes opened my heart towards her . How could I show my gratitude better for the money I had just earned , than by bestowing a share in charity upon worthy objects ? So I took out my purse , an elegant little French one given me by dear mother , and placed my three new shillings in the poor creature 's hand , as she stood in the gutter . She was overpowered with gratitude , and could not speak for a moment . Then she came nearer , to bless me . "
59874	59941	59868	59868	He	2123	" Snap - she had got my purse and was out of sight in the fog . Georgiana 's red heels were the last thing I saw . For an instant I could not believe it ; but thought that the fog had affected my sight . Then I darted across the road , almost under the feet of a horse , and down a place called "
59945	60203	59868	59868	He	2123	" It was hopeless , utterly hopeless ; and not only my three pounds were gone , but half besides of all I had in the world . I had taken that money with me , because I meant , if fortunate with my landscape , to buy a large box of colours in Rathbone - place ; but the fog had deterred me . She had snatched my purse while I tried to clasp it , for my glove had first got in the way . All was gone , dear mother 's gift , my first earnings , and all . More than all I felt sore at heart from the baseness of the robbery . Nothing is so bitterly grievous to youth as a blow to faith in one 's species . I am not ashamed to confess that feeling all alone in the fog , I leaned against some iron railings and cried away like a child . Child I was still at heart , despite all my trials and spirit ; and more so perhaps than girls who have played out their childhood . In the full flow of my passion , for I was actually sobbing aloud , ashamed of myself all the while , I felt an arm steal round my waist , and starting in fear of another thief , confronted the loveliest face that human eyes ever looked on . With soft caresses , and sweetest smiles , it drew close to my own stormy and bitter countenance . "
60245	60246	60247	60247	You	2127	" "
60253	60260	60247	60247	You	2127	" I exclaimed through my sobs : "
60282	60283	60247	60247	You	2127	" "
60314	60315	60297	60298	My father	734	" "

60409	60466	60468	60468	me	0	" And to prove my point , I told her of this new trouble , hinted at previous ones and my many great losses , of which money was the least . Even without the controversial spirit , I must have told her all . There was no denying anything to such a winning loving face . "
60470	60504	60506	60506	me	0	" she cried very thoughtfully , with her mites of hands out of her muff - she had the prettiest set of fur I ever beheld , and how it became her ! - "
60537	60559	60523	60523	You	2127	" - this was said so sagely that I could have kissed her all over like a duck of a baby . "
60639	60640	60633	60633	you	2127	" "
60647	60648	60645	60645	I	0	" "
60749	60780	60727	60727	you	2127	" And the lively little thing clapped her hands at the prospect , quite forgetting that she had just offered me all her store . Presently this occurred to her . "
60894	61123	61125	61125	I	0	" I yielded at once . She was so loving and natural , I could not resist her . She broke upon me like soft sunshine through the fog , laughing , smiling , dancing , her face all light and warmth , yet not a shallow light , but one that played up from the fount of tears . Her deep rich violet eyes seldom used their dark lashes , except when she was asleep . She was life itself , quick , playful , loving life , feeling for and with all life around ; pitying , trusting , admiring all things ; yet true as the hearth to household ties . I never found another such nature : it was the perfection of maiden womanhood , even in its unreason . And therefore nobody could resist her . With me , of ten times her strength of will , and power of mind - small though it be - she could do in a moment exactly as she liked ; I mean of course in trivial matters . It was impossible to be offended with her . When she had led me a few steps towards her home - for I went with her not , of course , to take her money , but to see her safe , she turned round suddenly : - "
61196	61221	61186	61186	I	0	" This she said with the finest air of protection imaginable . I gave her my name and address , and asked for hers . "
61291	61344	61271	61271	they	2158	" Off she danced through the fog ; and I went sadly home , yet thinking more of her , than of my serious and vexatious loss . CHAPTER XII . Inspector Cutting , upon the first tidings of the robbery , came at once , and assured me that he knew the "
61346	61362	61271	61271	they	2158	" well , and wanted her for several other plants , and crafty as she was "
61364	61617	61271	61271	they	2158	" was the elegant word he used he was sure to be down upon her in the course of a very short time . Isola Ross , to my great surprise , did not come the next day , nor even the day after ; so I set out to look for her , at the same time wondering at myself for doing so . Knowing that College Street must take its name from some academic building in or near it , I concluded of course that there I should find Professor Ross and my lovely new friend . So without consulting Mrs. Shelfer , who would have chattered for an hour , away I went one tine frosty morning to ask about the College . I found that a low unsightly building , which I had often passed , near the bottom of the street , was the only College there ; so I entered a small quadrangle , to make further inquiries . The first person I saw was a young man dressed like one of my father 's grooms , and cracking a long whip and whistling . He had a brilliant scarlet neckcloth , green sporting coat , and black boots up to his knees . I studied him for a moment because it struck me that he would look well in a foreground , when toned down a little , as water colours would render him . He appreciated my attention , and seemed proud of it . "
61631	61674	61675	61676	Splendid filly	2161	" He must have been three parts drunk , or he would never have dared to address me so . Of course I made no answer , but walked on . He cracked his whip like a pistol , to startle me . "
61678	61684	61675	61676	Splendid filly	2161	" I heard him mutter , "
61690	61722	61724	61724	you	2162	" What he meant I do not know or care . The next I met was a fussy little man , dressed all in brown , who smelt of musty hay . "
61729	61733	61724	61724	you	2162	" I asked , "
61741	61763	61724	61724	you	2162	" Ross , Ross ! Do n't know the name . No Ross about here . What 's he Professor of ? "
61764	61780	61724	61724	you	2162	" That I was not told . But it is something the young ladies study . "
61781	61813	61724	61724	you	2162	" No young ladies about here . But I see you have brought your dear mamma 's lapdog . Take it out of the bag . Let me look at it . "
61814	61821	61724	61724	you	2162	" Is not this the College ? "
61822	61842	61724	61724	you	2162	" Yes to be sure . The best College in London . Quick , let me see the dog . "
61843	61857	61724	61724	you	2162	" I have no dog , sir . I have made some mistake . "
61858	61874	61724	61724	you	2162	" Then you have got a pony . Pet over - fed . Shetland breed . "
61875	61891	61724	61724	you	2162	" No indeed . Nothing except myself ; and I am looking for Miss Ross . "
61892	61938	61941	61941	he	2163	" Young lady , you have made a very great mistake . You have kept me five minutes from a lecture on the navicular disease . And my practice is controverted by an upstart youth from the country . I am in search of authorities . "
61986	61994	61996	61997	the woman	824	" Oh , them 's the weterans , "
61999	62007	61996	61997	the woman	824	" and a precious set they be ! "
62008	62018	61996	61997	the woman	824	" Why , they did not look like soldiers . "
62019	62049	61996	61997	the woman	824	" No , no , Miss. Weterans , where they takes in all the sick horses and dogs . And very clever they are , I have heard say . "
62050	62062	61996	61997	the woman	824	" And where is the College where the young ladies are ? "
62063	62095	61996	61997	the woman	824	" I do n't know of no other College nearer than High Street , where the boys wear flat caps . But there 's a girls ' school down the road . "
62096	62113	61996	61997	the woman	824	" I do n't want a school . I want a College where young ladies go . "
62114	62123	61996	61997	the woman	824	" Then I ca nt help you , Miss. "
62133	62141	62143	62145	the little woman	2168	" Bless my soul , Miss Valence , "
62153	62185	62143	62145	the little woman	2168	" have you been among them niggers ? It 's a mercy they did n't skin and stuff you . What do you think now they did to my old Tom ? "
62186	62195	61996	61997	the woman	824	" How can I guess , Mrs. Shelfer ? "
62196	62431	61996	61997	the woman	824	" No , no , to be sure not . I forgot , my good friend . Why , they knowed him well it seems , because he had been there in dear Miss Minto 's time , for a salmon bone that had got crossways in his oesop , so they said at least , but they are the biggest liars - so only a year ago come next Boxing - day , here comes to the door half a dozen of them , bus - cad and coachman all in one , all looking as grave as judges . When I went to the door they all pulled their hats off , as if I had been the Queen at the very least . ' What can I do for you , my good friends ? ' says I ; for Shelfer was out of the way , and catch me letting them in for all their politeness . No , no , thank you . ' Mrs. Shelfer , ' says the biggest of them , a lantern - jawed young fellow with covers over his pockets , ' Mrs. Shelfer , you are possessed of a most remarkable cat . An animal , ma'am , of unparalleled cemetery and organic dewelopment . Our Professor , ma'am , is delivering a course of lectures on the Canonical Heapatightness of the Hirumbillycuss . "
62432	62446	62143	62145	the little woman	2168	" Well done , Mrs. Shelfer ! What a memory you must have ! "
62447	62800	61996	61997	the woman	824	" Pretty well , Miss , pretty well . Particular for long words , when I likes the sound of them . ' Well sir , ' I says , feeling rather taken aback , ' thank God I have n't got it . ' ' No , ma'am , ' says he , ' your blooming countenance entirely negatives any such dyingnoses . But the Professor , in passing the other morning , observed some symptoms of it in your magnificent cat , for whom he entertains the most sincere attachment , and whom he will cure for our advancement and edification upon the lecture table . And now , ma'am , Professor Sallenders desires his most respectful compliments , and will you allow us to take that dear good cat to be cured . The Professor was instrumental once in preserving his honoured existence , therefore he feels assured that you will not now refuse him . ' Well you see , Miss , I did n't half like to let him go , but I was afraid to offend the Professor , because of all my animals , for I knew that he could put a blight upon them , birds and all , if he chose . Old Tom was lying roasting his back again the fender , the same as you see him now , poor soul ; so I catched him up and put him in a double covered basket , with a bit of flannel over him , because the weather was cold ; and he was so clever , would you believe it , he put up his old paws to fight me , he knew he was going to mischief , and that turned me rather . ' Now will you promise to bring him back safe ? ' I says . ' Ma'am , ' says the lantern - jawed young man , bowing over his heart , and as serious as a pulpit , ' Ma'am , in less than an hour . Rely upon the honour of Weteran Arian Gent . "
62801	62827	61996	61997	the woman	824	" Well , Mrs. Shelfer , I am astonished . Even I should never have been so silly . Poor old Tom among the Philistines ! "
62828	63390	63391	63394	The poor little woman	2169	" Well , Miss , I began to feel very uneasy directly they was gone . I thought they looked back so queerly , and old Tom was mewing so dreadful in the basket . Presently I began to hear a mewing out of the cupboard , and a mewing out of the clock , and even out of the dripping - pan . So I put on my bonnet as quick as I could , and ran right away to the College , and somehow or other by the time I got there , I was in a fright all over . As good luck would have it , the man was at the gate ; a nice respectable married man , and a friend of Charley 's . ' Curbs , ' I says , ' where is Professor Sallenders ? ' ' Down in the country , ' says he , ' since last Friday . He never stops here at Christmas , Mrs. Shelfer , he 's a deal too knowing for that . ' My heart went pop , Miss , like an oyster shell in the fire . I held on by the door , and I thought it was all up with me . ' Do n't take on so , Missus , ' says Curbs , ' if any of your museum is ill , there 's half a dozen clever young coves in the operating room over there , only they 're busy just now , cutting up a big black cat . My eyes , how he did squeal ! ' I screamed out and ran - Curbs thought I was mad , and he was not far out - bang went the door before me , and there on the table , with the lantern - jawed young man flourishing a big knife over him , there lay my precious old Tom strapped down on his back , with his mouth tied up in white tape , and leather gloves over his feet , and sticks trussed across him the same as a roasting rabbit , and a streak of white all along his blessed stomach - you know , Miss , he had n't got one white hair by rights - where the niggers had shaved and floured him , to see what they were about . He turned up his dear old eyes when he saw me ; it would have made you cry , and he tried to speak . Oh you precious old soul , did n't I scatter them right and left ? I scratched that lantern - jawed hypocrite 's face till I gave him the hirumbillycuss and hirumtommycuss too , I expect . I called a policeman in , and there was n't one of them finished his Christmas in London . But the poor old soul has never been the same cat since . The anxiety he was in , turned his hair white on both sides of his heart and all round the backs of his ears . He would n't come to the door , he shook so , at the call of the cat's - meat man for better than a month , and he wo n't look at it now , while there 's a skewer in it . "
63884	63893	63898	63898	he	424	" Cut it short , old ' ooman , "
63990	63993	63994	63994	everybody	1910	" Charley Shelfer "
64115	64533	64100	64100	I	0	" as Mrs. Shelfer called it among his brother gardeners . Sometimes , he brought home beautiful plants , perfectly lovely flowers , unknown to me even by name , and many of these he presented to me by Mrs. Shelfer 's hands . Every Sunday morning he was up before the daylight , and away for an excursion , or rather an incursion , through the Hampstead , Highgate , and Holloway district . From these raids he used to return as I came home from the morning service . By the way , if I had wanted to puzzle him and find a blank in his universal acquaintance , the best chance would have been to ask him about the clergyman . He never gave the pew - openers any trouble , neither indeed did Mrs. Shelfer , who called herself a Catholic ; but the lively little woman 's chiefest terror was death , and a parson to her was always an undertaker . If Mr. Shelfer had not spent the Sunday morning quite so well as I had , at any rate he had not wasted his time . I think he must have robbed hen - roosts and allotment grounds ; and yet he was too respectable for that . But whence and how could he ever have come by the gipsey collection he always produced from his hat , from his countless pockets , from his red cotton handkerchief , every Sunday at 1 P.M. ? Eggs , chickens , mushrooms , sticks of horseradish and celery , misletoe - thrushes , cucumbers , cabbages red and white , rabbits , watercress , Aylesbury ducks - I can not remember one quarter of his manifold forage . All I can say is , that if these things are to be found by the side of the road near London , Middlesex is a far better field for the student of natural history than Gloucestershire , or even beloved Devon . Mrs. Shelfer said it was all his luck ; but I hardly think it could have rained Aylesbury ducks , even for Mr. Shelfer . All the time he was extracting from his recesses this multifarious store , he never once smiled , or showed any symptoms of triumph , but gravely went through the whole , as if a simple duty . How was it such a man had not made his fortune ? Because he had an incurable habit of "
64536	65005	64100	64100	I	0	" for any one who asked him ; and hence he was always in trouble . Mrs. Shelfer and I were admitted readily into the school of design . It was a long low room , very badly lighted , and fitted up for the time until a better could be provided . It looked very cold and comfortless ; forms instead of chairs , and desks like a parish school . The whitewashed walls were hung with diagrams , sections , tracings , reductions , most of them stiff and ugly , but no doubt instructive . At one end was a raised platform , reserved for lecturers and the higher powers . Shelves round the wall were filled with casts and models , and books of instruction were to be had out of cupboards . Of course we were expected to bring our own materials , and a code of rules was exhibited . The more advanced students were permitted to tender any work of their own which might be of service to the neophytes . From no one there did I ever receive any insolence . At first , the young artists used to look at me rather hard , but my reserved and distant air was quite enough to discourage them . After the introduction , which Mrs. Shelfer accomplished in very great style , I dismissed her , and set to in earnest to pore once more over the rudiments of perspective . One simple truth as to the vanishing point struck me at once . I was amazed that I had never perceived it before . It was not set forth in the book I was studying ; but it was the sole key to all my errors of distance . At once I closed the book ; upon that one subject I wanted no more instruction , I had caught the focus of truth . Books , like bad glass , would only refract my perception . All I wanted now was practice and adaptation of the eye . Strange as it seemed to me then , I could draw no more that day . I was so overcome at first sight by the simple beauty of truth , mathematical yet poetical truth , that error and obscurity for there is a balance in all things had their revenge for a while on my brain . But the truth , once seen , could never be lost again . Thenceforth there were few higher penances for me , in a small way , than to look at one of my early drawings . When my brain was clear , I returned to do a real day 's work . For the cups , and vases , and plates , and things of "
65008	65118	65147	65148	Clara Vaughan	300	" as they chose to call it , I did not care at all ; but the copies and models and figures were most useful to me . Unless I am much mistaken , I made more advance in a fortnight there , than I had in any year of my life before . With my usual perseverance - if I have no other virtue , I have that - I worked away to correct my many shortcomings ; not even indulging much as I wanted the money in any attempts at a finished drawing , until I felt sure that all my foundations were thoroughly laid and set . "
65122	65128	65147	65148	Clara Vaughan	300	" I cried towards Christmas , "
65150	65576	65147	65148	Clara Vaughan	300	" It did me good when I was alone , to call myself by my own name , and my right to be my father 's daughter . CHAPTER XIV . Meanwhile old Christmas was come , and all I was worth in the world was change for half a sovereign . True , my lodgings were paid for , a fortnight in advance , because good Mrs. Shelfer wanted to treat all her pets to a Christmas dinner ; but as for my own Christmas dinner - though I ca n't say I cared much for it - if I got one at all , it must be upon credit , since my drawing would not be finished for another week . Credit , of course , I would not think of . Any day in the week or year , I would rather starve than owe money . However , I was not going to cry about plum - pudding , though once or twice it made me hungry to think of the dinner in the great hall at Vaughan Park on the Christmas eve ; a much more elaborate matter in the old time , than the meal served in the dining - room next day . Now I sat in my little room this dreary Christmas eve ; and do what I would , I could not help thinking a little . It was a gusty evening , cold and damp , with scuds of sleet and snow , as yet it had not made up its mind whether to freeze or thaw . Nevertheless , the streets were full of merry laughing parties , proud of their bargains for the Christmas cheer ; and as they went by , the misletoe and the holly glistened in the flickering gaslight . For old recollection 's sake , I had made believe to dress my little room with some few sprigs of laurel and unberried holly ; the sceptre branch , all cobbed with coral beads , was too expensive for me . Misletoe I wanted not . Who was there now to kiss me ? From the sheer craving of human nature for a word of kindness , I had called , that afternoon , upon Mrs. Elton . But good as she was and sweet to me , she had near relatives coming ; and I saw or fancied , that I should be in the way . Yet I thought that her mother heart yearned toward me as she said "
65580	66191	65147	65148	Clara Vaughan	300	" and showed me out by the Christmas tree , all trembling to be lighted . Now I sat alone and lonely by the flickering of three pennyworth of wood which I had bought recklessly for the sake of the big ash - tree that used to glow with the lichen peeling round it on the old Christmas hearth , where I was believed the heiress . The little spark and sputter of my sallow billet chopped by the poor old people at St. Pancras workhouse led me back through eight sad years to the last merry time when my father was keeping his latest Christmas , and I his pride and hope was prouder than all , at being just ten years old . How he carved and ladled the gravy ; how he flourished his knife and fork with a joke all hot for every one ; how he smiled when the thrice - helped farmers sent for another slice , and laughed when the crow - boy was nearly choked with plum - pudding ; how he patted me on the head and caught me for a kiss , when I , dressed up as head - waitress , with my long hair all tied back , pulled his right arm and pointed to widow Hiatt 's plate - the speech he made after dinner , when I was amazed at his eloquence and clapped my little hands , and the way he made me stand up on a chair and drink the Queen 's health first - then the hurrahs of the tenants and servants , and how they kissed me outside - all this goes through my memory as the smoke of the billet goes up the chimney , and the tears steal under my eyelids . Then I see the long hall afterwards , with the tables cleared away and the lights hung round the tapestry , and the yule log roaring afresh ; my father a type of the true English gentleman , not of the past but the present century , holding the hand of his wife a lady of no condescending airs , but true womanly warmth and love - both dressed for the tenants ' ball as if for the lord - lieutenant 's ; both eager to lead off the country dance , and beating their feet to the music . Next them , a laughing child in a little white frock and pink slip scarce to be known for myself , hand - in - hand with my brave chevalier , Master Roderick Blount , accounted by Cooky and both lady's - maids , and most of all by himself , my duly affianced lord . Then the housekeeper , starched beyond measure , yet not too stiff to smile , and open for the nonce even to jokes about courtship , yielding her gracious hand for the dance to the senior tenant , a man with great calves , red face , and snow - white hair . After them come - Hark ! a loud knock and a ring . It is just in time before I begin the palinode . Who can want me to - night ? I want no one but those I can not have , whom the fire has now restored me , though the earth has hidden them . Mrs. Shelfer is hard at work in the kitchen , preparing a wonderful supper for Charley , who has promised to come home . She has canvassed the chance of his keeping this promise fifty times in the day . Hope cries "
66194	66197	65147	65148	Clara Vaughan	300	" experience whispers "
66200	66224	66225	66226	Miss Valence	435	" At any rate the knock is not his , for he always carries a latch - key . She calls up the stairs "
66228	66287	66225	66226	Miss Valence	435	" before she goes to the door , for who knows but she might be murdered in the midst of her Christmas pudding ? I come out to prove my existence and stand in the dark on the landing . She draws back the bolt ; I hear a gruff voice as if it came through a hat . "
66300	66301	66295	66296	Clara Waun	456	" "
66316	66317	66307	66308	Miss Valence	435	" "
66331	66332	66329	66329	Waun	456	" "
66349	66350	66336	66338	my good friend	5901	" "
66389	66488	66376	66376	Walence	457	" Jim , from the top of the van , suggests that , after all , Walence and Waun be much of a muchness . For his part , he 'll be blessed if he 'll go any further with it . Let him and Ben look at the young lady , and see if she be like the card . Meanwhile , of course , I come forward and claim the parcel , whatever it is . Mrs. Shelfer redoubles her assurances , and calls the man a great oaf , which has more effect than anything . "
66518	66519	66522	66522	he	409	" "
66544	66570	66571	66571	Waun	456	" This fact is decisive . Who can doubt any more ? But for all that , the book must be signed in the name of "
66573	66612	66571	66571	Waun	456	" with which of course I comply . When the two strong men have , with much difficulty of which they made much more , lowered the enormous package from the van , Ben stands wiping his forehead . "
66701	66702	66697	66697	you	458	" "
66705	66709	66697	66697	you	458	" replies Jim , "
66793	66794	66784	66784	Ben	459	" "
66801	66815	66818	66818	miss	5418	" I ask , trembling for my change of the half - sovereign . "
66881	66912	66916	66917	Miss Valence	435	" Away they go with the smoking horses , after carrying into the little kitchen the mighty maun , which Mrs. Shelfer , with my assistance , could not stir . "
66923	66997	66916	66917	Miss Valence	435	" cries Mrs. Shelfer , when the full light falls upon it . The direction was written in round hand upon a strip of parchment , about four inches wide and at least eight feet in length . It came from the bottom all up over the cover and down upon the other side , so that no one could open the basket without breaking it asunder . It was as follows : - "
67100	67195	67092	67092	his	305	" I wondered much whether Mr. Beany Dawe had been called in to achieve this masterpiece of manuscript , which was all in large round hand , but without any stops . It seemed beyond poor Sally 's art , yet were some loops and downstrokes that must be dear little Sally 's . I took it off with much trouble - the parchment was joined in four places - and I have it now . Meanwhile Mrs. Shelfer was dancing around it , neglecting her supper in the wonder of this gigantic hamper . "
67221	67593	67597	67599	my good friend	5901	" However , I did get it open at last , and never shall I forget the contents . There was a month 's food for a family of twelve . First came hay , such as I never smelt out of Devonshire ; then eighteen rolls of butter , each with a snowy cloth around it ; the butter so golden even at that time of year , that Mrs. Shelfer compared it to the yolk of an egg looking out of the white . Then a storey of clotted cream and beautiful lard and laver , which they knew I loved . Then a floor of hay . Below it a pair of guinea fowls , two large turkeys , and most carefully wrapped from the rest a fine hare filled with dried sweet herbs . Below these a flitch of bacon , two wood - smoked hams , a pair of tongues , a leg of Exmoor mutton , and three bottles of best elder wine . Then a brown paper parcel containing Sally 's last copy - book I had set her copies for half a year to come and a long letter , the first I had ever received from Tossil 's Barton . When all was out at last , after the greatest delight and laughter as each thing appeared , I fell back in utter dismay at the spectacle before me . Mrs. Shelfer sat on the floor unable to find her way out , she was so flounced and tippeted with good things . When I came to her relief , she did nothing but go round and round what was left of the little room , humming a Catholic hymn , and pressing both hands to her side . But something must be done at once . Waste is wickedness ; how could we stave it off ? Everything would depend upon the weather . At present all was beautifully fresh , thanks to the skilful packing and the frost , albeit the mighty package had made the round of all the Albert Streets in London . Mrs. Shelfer would have looked at it for a month , and at intervals exclaimed , "
67614	67615	67597	67599	my good friend	5901	" "
67682	67683	67690	67690	Miss	2239	" "
67692	67693	67690	67690	Miss	2239	" "
67734	68065	67722	67722	I	0	" So we got all that was taintable into the little yard , while Tom , who never stole , except when quite sure of impunity , looked on very sagely . There we fixed it all up to the wall secure , except from cats , of whom a roving band serenaded me every night . I presented Mrs. Shelfer at once with a turkey - a specimen of natural history not found by the roadside , even on Mr. Shelfer 's Sabbath journey - also a ham , and three rolls of butter . As to the rest , I would think what to do with it afterwards . Mrs. Shelfer kept off the cats until midnight , after which I held them at bay by the following means . With one of my mineral paints mingled with some phosphorus , I drew upon a black board a ferocious terrier , the size of life , with fangs unsheathed , bristles erect , and eyes starting out of his head . We tried the effect in the dark on poor Tom , who arched his back , and sputtered with the strongest execration , then turned and fled ignobly , amid roars of laughter from Mr. Shelfer , who by this time was come home . This one - headed Cerberus being hung so as to oscillate in the wind , right across the cat - leap , I felt quite safe , so long as my chemical mixture should continue luminous . CHAPTER XV . Dear little Sally 's letter gave me the greatest delight . It was all in round hand , and had taken at least a week to write , and she must have washed her hands almost every time . There were no stops in it , but I have put some . The spelling was wonderfully good for her , but here and there I have shaped it to the present fashion . "

69775	70534	69722	69722	his	305	" of that where the delivery of letters depended so much upon luck . Of their Christmas present to me I resolved to give the surplus to those who would be the better for it , and not according to the usual law of such things to those who did not want it , and would make return with interest . So on the Christmas morning Mrs. Shelfer and myself , each carrying a large basket , went to the mews round the corner , and distributed among the poor lodgers there , more Christmas dinners than had ever entered those doors before ; and how grateful the poor things were , only they all wanted the best . Now the school of design was closed for a while , and I worked hard for several days at the landscape for Mr. Oxgall , though the store of provisions sent me and the rent enclosed in the turkey had saved me from present necessity . On the day of all days in the year the saddest and darkest to me , I could not keep to my task , but went for a change of thoughts to the school , now open again . It was the 30th of December , 1850 , and , though I crouch not to the mumming of prigs scolloped out at the throat , who block out with a patchwork screen the simple hearth of religion , and kneel at an ashbin to warm themselves ; though I do n't care a herring for small anniversaries dotted all over the calendar , and made by some Murphy of old ; yet I reverence deeply the true feasts of Church and Chapel , the refreshings of faith and charity , whereupon we forgive and are sorry for those who work hard to mar them . Neither does it seem to me - so far as my timid and wavering judgment extends - to be superstition or vanity , if we dare to set mark by those dates in our own little span which God has scarred on our memory . In the long dark room so bare and comfortless , and , to - day , so lonely and cold , I got my usual books and studies , and tried , all in vain , to fix my attention on them . Finding the effort so fruitless , I packed up my things in the little black bag and rose to depart . Turning round , I saw on the table , where students ' works were exhibited , a small object newly placed there . It was a statuette in white marble of a magnificent red deer , such as I had seen once or twice in the north of Devon . The listening attitude , the turn of the neck , the light poise of the massive head , even the mild , yet spirited eye , and the quivering sensitive lip , I could answer for them all , they were done to the very life . Truth , power , and elegance triumphed in every vein of it . For a minute I stood overcome with wonder . If this were the work of a youthful sculptor , England might hope at last for something beyond the grotesque . Before me rose at once all the woodland scenery , the hill - side garbed with every shade of green , the brambled quarry standing forth , the trees , the winding vales embosoming the light , the haze that hovers above the watersmeet , bold crests of amaranth heath behind , and far away the russet wold of Exmoor . The stag in the foreground of my landscape , I feel so grateful to him for this expanse of vision that I stoop down and kiss him , while no one can see me . As I bend , the gordit drops from its warm home in my breast . By some impulse undefined I lift the ribbon from my neck , and hang the little fairy 's heart on the antlers of the Devonshire deer . Out springs from behind a chest full of casts and models - what model can compare with her ? - the loveliest of all lovely beings , my little Isola Ross . I hide the tears in my eyes , and try to look cold and reserved . What use is it ? One smile of hers would have disarmed Belial . "
70728	71740	70723	70723	their	2340	" Poor little dear ! I lived upstairs , and could not have seen her without standing out on the balcony , which was about the size of a chess - board . If she had not been so simple as to walk on my side of the street , she must have seen me ere long , for I sat all day near the window to draw , when I was not away at my school . I forgave her most graciously for having done me no wrong , and kissed her with all my heart . Her breath was as sweet as violets in Spring clover , and her lips warm and soft as a wren 's nest . On receiving my forgiveness , away she went dancing down the long room , with her cloak thrown off , and her hair tossing all out of braid , and her exquisite buoyant figure floating as if on a cloud . Of course there was no one there , or even impulsive Isola would hardly have taken her frolic ; and yet I am not sure . She never thought harm of any one , and never imagined that any one could think harm of her . After a dozen flits of some rapid elegant dance quite unknown to me who have never had much of dancing , but which I supposed to be Scotch , back she came out of breath , and kissed me ever so many times , and kissed my gordit too , and told me never to part with it . One thing she was sure of , that her Papa could not resist me now , and when he was told of it I should come to their house the next day . And she knew I was dreadfully proud , but would I , for her sake , forgive her Pappy ? Of course , he knew nothing about me , and she had never told him my name , though she could not help telling my story , at least all she knew of it ; but he was so dreadfully jealous of her , he did not want any one to have a touch of her glove but himself . Looking at her pure sweet face , I could well believe it ; but how could he bear to see that dear little thing go three days without food ? Most likely she had exaggerated . Although she was truthful as light , sometimes her quick fancy and warmth , like the sunshine itself , would bring out some points too strongly . However , I was prepared , without that , to dislike the Professor , for , as a general rule , I do n't like men who moralise ; at least if their philosophy is frigid . Nevertheless , I promised very readily to forgive her Papa , for I did so love that Isola . Her nature was so different to mine , so light and airy , elastic and soft ; in short if I must forsake my language , the complement of my own . We chatted , or rather she did , for at least half an hour ; and then she told me old Cora was coming to fetch her at three o'clock . Once more I rose to depart , for I feared she might get into trouble , if the old nurse should find her so intimate with a stranger . But Isola told me that she did not care for her a bit , and she had quite set her heart on my meeting her brother Conrad , the sculptor of that magnificent stag . Perhaps he would come with Cora , but he was so altered now , she could never tell what he would do . Since the time she first saw me , Conrad had come of age , and she could not guess what it was all about , but there had been a dreadful disturbance between him and his father , and he had actually gone to live away from the family . She thought it must be about money , or some such nasty thing ; but even Cora did not know , or if she did , the old thing would not tell . It had made poor Isola cry till her eyes were sore , but now she supposed she must make up her mind to it all . But she would tell the truth , she did hate being treated like a baby when she was a full - grown woman ; how much taller did they expect her to be ? And what was much worse , she did want so to comfort them both , and how could she do it without knowing what was the matter ? It was too bad , and she wished she was a boy , with all her heart she did . She went on talking like this till her gentle breast fluttered , and her coral lips quivered , and the tears stole down her long lashes , and she crept to me closer for comfort . I was clasping her round little waist , and kissing the bright drops away , when in burst a dark , scraggy woman , who must , of course , be old Cora . She tore the poor child from my arms , and scowled at me fiercely enough to frighten a girl unacquainted with real terrors . I met her dark gaze with a calm contempt , beneath which it quailed and fell . She mumbled some words in a language or patois , which I supposed to be Gaelic , and led off her charge towards the door . She had mistaken her adversary . Was I to be pushed aside , like a gingerbread woman tempting a weak - stomached child ? I passed them ; then turned and confronted the hag . "
71790	72384	71777	71777	you	2342	" Isola was too frightened to speak . I know not what would have been the result , if the old hag , who was glaring about , rather taken aback , but still clutching that delicate arm , had not suddenly spied my fairy 's heart , as yet unrestored to its sanctuary . She stared , for a moment , in wide amazement ; then her whole demeanour was altered . She cringed , and fawned , and curtseyed , as if I had worn a tiara . She dropped my dear Isola 's arm , and fell behind like a negress . My poor little pet was trembling and cold with fright , for as she told me afterwards she had never seen old Cora in such a passion before , and the superstitious darling dreaded the evil eye . As we went towards Isola 's home , I could not help thinking how fine the interview would be between Mrs. Shelfer and Cora , if I only chose to carry that vanquished beldame thither ; but sage discretion was I not now eighteen ? , and the thought of that solemn day prevented me . So I took them straight home , leading Isola while she guided me , and turning sometimes , with complacency , to encourage old Cora behind us . The house they lived in was a high but narrow one , dull - looking and dark , with area rails in front . Some little maiden came to the door , and I took my leave on the steps . Dear Isola , now in high spirits again , kissed me , like a peach quite warm in the sun , and promised to come the next day , about which there could now be no difficulty . Old Cora bent low as she wished me good evening and begged leave to kiss my cordetto . This I granted , but took good care not to let it pass out of my hands ; she admired it so much , especially when allowed to examine it , and there was such a greedy light in her eyes , that I was quite sure she would steal it upon the first chance ; and therefore I went straightway and bought a guard of thick silk cord , as a substitute for the black riband , which was getting worn . And so I came home before dark , full of wonder , but feeling rather triumphant , and greatly delighted at having recovered dear Isola . END OF VOL . I. BOOK II . continued . CHAPTER XVII . Late in the evening of that same day , I sat in my room by the firelight only for I could not work and tried to look into myself , and find out the cause of my strange attraction or rather impulsion towards Isola . Somehow or other I did not wonder so much that she should be drawn quite as strongly towards me , although an impartial observer would perhaps have wondered far more . Alter puzzling myself in vain with this inquiry , my thoughts began to move , in their usual gloomy train . Eight years had now elapsed , and what had I discovered ? Nothing ; but at long dark intervals some impress of the deed itself , more than of the doer . Had I halted in pursuit , or had my vengeance cooled ? To the former question my conscience answered "
72387	72391	71777	71777	you	2342	" to the latter "
72394	72746	72747	72748	Miss Valence	435	" Gentle influences had been shed around me , sorrow had bedewed the track of hate , intercourse with happy harmless people , and gratitude for unmerited kindness ; it was not in human nature , however finely constitute for evil , entirely to repulse these powers . I could not deny , that the religion of my heart , during the last twelvemonth , had been somewhat neglected . For my devotion to dear mother , no plea was required . But the time since that , what business had I with laughing children , and snug firesides , with dickybirds , and Sandy the squirrel ? Even sweet Isola caused me a pang of remorse ; but no , I could not quite abandon her . But now , thank God , I was in the right road again , and plodding resolutely as my father could expect . To his spirit , ever present with me , I knelt down and poured out my remorse ; and swore to make amends , whatever it might cost me . Yet even then , a gentle shadow seemed to come as well , and whisper the words that calmed the face of death . My musings , if so mild a word may suit them , were roughly interrupted by a loud step on the stairs . Inspector Cutting , who could walk when needful like a cat , loved to redress this injury to the Goddess Echo , by making double noise when not on business . Farmer Huxtable , a man of twice the weight , would have come up those stairs at half the expense in sound . When he entered the room , he found himself in a semi - official state again , and I saw that he was not come for nothing . In a few brief words , he told me what he had done , which was not very much ; or perhaps my suspicion was right , that he only told me a part of it . Then he said abruptly , "

73654	74157	73647	73647	I	0	" I was thinking of dear mother ; and began to feel already that my character was changing . CHAPTER XVIII . Inspector Cutting gave me some minute instructions , and in less than half an hour we set forth upon our enterprise . I was wrapped in a loose grey cloak having a hooded cape ; and carefully hidden I carried for self - defence a very keen stiletto . I had procured it indirectly from the best cutler in London , but neither workmanship nor material could be compared to that of Italy . The night was dark and cold , the streets were almost deserted , and all the shops except the chemists ' and the public - houses closed . We walked straightway to the nearest cabstand , where Mr. Cutting ordered a vehicle , and put me inside , himself riding with the driver . So little did I know as yet of London , that after the first turn or two , I could not even guess what direction we were taking . I had such confidence in my guide , a staid respectable man with a grown up family , that I never thought there could be harm in my journeying with him at night . And even had I thought so , most likely I should have done it all the same . Ever since the time he wounded me , or allowed me to wound myself , his manner towards me had been most kind , considerate , and respectful ; though he found it his duty now and then to repress my impetuosity . With all my perception alert , I kept a sharp look - out from the window , but vainly strove to find anything that might serve for a landmark . Once we stopped for about five minutes , at a police - station somewhere in Clerkenwell , where , by the light of a lamp , I read , without leaving the cab , the ghastly descriptions of all the dead bodies recently found in London and waiting identification . Hereupon my courage began to ooze , and the weather seemed much colder . The type was hard to read at that distance , and the imagination had fair play , as it does when words come slowly . Anon the inspector reappeared , so altered in dress and countenance , that I did not know him until he made me a bow . With a glance of encouragement , and a little grin of dry humour , he mounted the box again . After another long drive , in the course of which we ran silently over a wooden road , - probably High Holborn , - we stopped in a broad but deserted thoroughfare , very badly lighted . Here Mr. Cutting opened the door , helped me out , and discharged the cab , but whispered something to the driver before he let him go . "

74372	74427	74428	74429	Poor child	5366	" This little dissertation was meant to divert my thoughts . I made no reply , being ignorant of such matters ; neither did I care to talk about them then . Nevertheless , I believe Inspector Cutting was wrong . As we entered a narrow street he suddenly turned and looked at me . "
74453	74454	74448	74448	you	5366	" "
74461	74471	74448	74448	you	5366	" But I tried in vain to think so . "

74536	74537	74520	74521	Inspector Cutting	423	" "
74571	74618	74558	74559	Inspector Cutting	423	" Hereupon he led me into a little room , fenced off from the bar of some refreshment - house . A glorious fire was burning , by which he set and left me . Presently he returned , with a small glass in his hand . "
74635	74653	74658	74658	you	423	" I saw by the firelight that it was brandy , or some dark - coloured spirit . "
74669	74691	74661	74661	you	423	" I threw such emphasis on the personal pronoun , and looked at him so indignantly , that he laughed outright . "
74710	74732	74704	74704	I	0	" And with that he tipped it off , and then returned to business , all the graver for the interlude . "
74766	75136	74761	74761	you	5366	" I assured him that I could very easily do so , and that it was nothing but the sudden effect of the cold . Forth we went again into the winter night , after I had learned from him that we were now in Whitechapel , not far from Goodman 's Fields . After another short walk , we came to the end of a narrow by - street , where there was an archway . Passing through this archway , we descended some steep and broken steps . Then the Inspector produced a small lamp brightly burning , which he must have lit at the public - house . It was not what is called a bull's - eye , but a reflector - lamp . By its light I saw that the chief entrance to the house must be round the corner , and perhaps in another street . With a small key which he took from his pocket , Mr. Cutting unlocked a little iron gate , and we entered a narrow passage . At the end of it was a massive door studded with great nails . Here my guide gave a gentle knock , and hid the lamp as before . Presently we heard a shrill sound from the keyhole , like a dryad 's voice . The Inspector stooped thereto , and pronounced the password . Not without some difficulty the lock was turned and the bolts withdrawn , and we stood inside . A child , under - sized and unnaturally sharp , stared at us for a moment , then dodged away from the lamp , as if more accustomed to darkness . Mr. Cutting closed the door and refastened it , then led me through some basement rooms unpaved and unfurnished , until we came to an iron step - ladder . This he ascended , and helped me up , and we found ourselves in a small dark lobby , containing no furniture , except a high three - legged stool . When he closed his lamp all around was dark , but on the rafters overhead a faint patch of light appeared - ceiling there was none . "
75143	75173	75138	75138	you	2380	" he whispered to me , pointing , as I could just perceive , to a narrow glazed opening high in the wall , whence the faint gleam proceeded . "
75188	75257	75258	75258	I	0	" He cast the light of his lamp upon the stool for a moment , while I did as he bade me . Standing there , I found that I was tall enough to look through ; but the narrow pane which formed the window was thickly covered with size , or some opaque integument . All I could tell was , that the space beyond was lighted . "

76112	76197	76110	76110	myself	0	" I whispered , as he glided out of sight along the vaults below . I could see no other entrance to the place in which I sat ; but how could I tell ? For a minute excitement kept me hot ; but as the last gleam of the light died upon the wall below , my heart began to throb heavily , and a chill came over me . The pulse thumped in my ears , like a knocking in the cellar . "
76202	77968	76110	76110	myself	0	" I asked myself , in scorn that I should ask . No , it was not fear , but horrible suspense . The balance of life and death , of triumph and disgrace , swung there before me in the dark , as if my breath would turn it . No dream of a child , no vagary of the brain - the clear perception of strong will and soul poised upon this moment . The moment was too long ; the powers began to fail , the senses grew more faint and confused at every heavy throb . Little images and little questions took the place of large ones . In vain I looked for even a cobweb , or the skeleton of a fly , where the dull light flickered through the pane of glass . In vain I listened for a mouse . Even a rat much as I hate him would have been welcome then . The repeater was purposely made so low of tick , that I got no comfort thence . All was deep , unfathomable silence , except the sound of my rebel heart . As a forlorn hope , I began to reckon sixty slowly , as a child keeps with a ticking clock . It would not do . My heart was beating louder than ever , and my hands were trembling ; even my teeth rattled like dice in a box as the time approached . The nerves will not be hoodwinked ; the mind can not swindle the body . I once slapped the cheeks of my governess . I can not treat nature so . Try the sweet influence , and the honest coin of reason . It will not do . All trembling , I strike the repeater . Five minutes more , and the trial must come . My heart is fluttering like a pigeon 's throat . The long suspense has been too much . Oh ! why was I submitted to this cruel ordeal ? The walls are thick . I can hear no movement in the secret room . There comes a creeping , fingering , sound , as of one whose candle is out , groping for the door . It passes along the pane of glass , and a shadow is thrown on the rafter . Who can it be ? What stealthy hand but that of my father 's murderer ? The word - the thought is enough . What resolution , reason , justice , all in turn , have failed to do , passion has done at once - passion at myself , as well as at my enemy . Is it Clara Vaughan , who , for eight long years of demon 's reign , has breathed but for this moment - is Clara Vaughan to shake like the wooden - legged blackbird now her chance is come ? A rush of triumph burned , like vitriol , through my veins . Every nerve was braced , every sense alert and eager . Against the light of that window , dull as it was , I could have threaded the finest needle that ever was made . I struck my repeater again . It was the hour , the minute , when my father died . With the mere spring of my instep I leaped upon the stool . I could see it clearly now . I dipped the broad camel's - hair brush in the flat phial , holding it carefully at arm 's length , and then drew it lightly along the pane , quite at the bottom , from corner to corner . One more dip , one more stripe above , a steam hovered on the glass , and there was a gazing - place , clear as crystal , and wide enough to show most of the narrow room . Of the room itself I took no heed ; the occupants were my study . Only four in all . One man at a high desk writing rapidly ; three men sitting round a small table , talking earnestly , and with much gesticulation , but the tone too low for me even to guess their language . From the appearance , manner , and action of the speakers , I felt sure that it was not English , and I thought that it was not French . Why , I can not say ; but my attention fixed itself upon the man who was writing at the top of the room . Perhaps it was because I could see him best , for he stood with his face full towards me . He was a man of middle age and stature , strongly framed , closely knit , and light of limb , with a handsome , keenly oval face , broad forehead , black eyes , glancing quickly and scornfully at his three comrades , long hair of an iron grey , falling on his shoulders , and tossed back often with a jerk of the head . His hands were white and restless , quick as light in their motion . On the left thumb flashed a large red jewel . Though I could not see the paper , I knew by the course of the quill that the writing was very small . But one minute I watched him , for the film was returning upon the glass , and I must scan the others ; yet in that time he had written several lines , half of them without looking at the paper , but with his eyes upon the other three . I knew him now he was in clear light , I could swear to him anywhere again . The last glance I could spare him sent a shudder through me , for in his impatience he shifted one foot from the shade of the desk . It was small , pointed , and elegant . The film was thickening , like frost upon the pane , when I began to observe the others . But I saw enough to print their faces on my memory , or those at least of two . The third I could not see so well . He seemed older than the rest . All the men wore loose grey tunics , with a red sash over the left shoulder . I judged that the three were debating hotly , as to some measure , upon which the fourth had resolved . Every now and then , they glanced at him uneasily . At him I gazed again , with deadly hatred , cold as ice , upon my heart . I felt my dagger handle . Oh for one moment with him ! In my fury I forgot the Inspector 's warning . The film was closing over . I touched the glass with my lashes . A flash of agony shot through my eyes . With a jerk I drew back , the stool rocked under me , one foot of it struck the wall . I clutched the window sill , and threw my weight inwards . Down came the foot of the stool , loud as the bang of a door . I thought it was all over . How I stifled a scream I know not ; had it escaped me , I should never have told this story . I had the presence of mind to stand still , and watch , though my eyes were maddening me , what the cut - throats would do . Through the agony , and the dimness , I could just see them all start , and rush to the door at the side of the room . The writer stood first , with his papers thrust anyhow into his bosom , a pistol in one hand , a poniard in the other . Did I know the shape of it ? The other three were armed , but I could not see with what . They crouched behind a heavy screen , presenting I supposed their pistol muzzles at the door . Finding no attack ensue , they began to search . Now was the real danger to me . If they searched that window before the size returned , my life ended there . Fear was past . Desperation seized me . If I was doomed to blindness , just as well to death . But I clutched my dagger . My left ear was against the wall . I heard a hand graze the partition inside , then a chair placed under the embrasure , and a step upon it . I was still upon the stool , stooping close beneath the window frame . Suddenly the light streak vanished , the size flew over it , as the breath flies over glass in the hardest frost . The hand felt along the window frame , the dull shadow of a head flitted upon the beam . It was within a foot of mine . The searcher passed on , without suspicion . Strange it was , but now the deadliest peril was over , triple fear fell upon me . The heat flew back to my heart , just now so stanch and rigid ; my hair seemed to creep with terror . Dear life , like true love scorned , would have its way within me . Quietly I slid down from the stool , and cowered upon it , in a storm of trembling . My eyelids dropped in agony , I could not lift them again , but blue and red lights seemed to dance within them . I had made up my mind to blindness ; but not , oh not just yet , to death . How long I remained in this abject state , scorning myself , yet none the braver , is more than I can tell , or even cared to ask . May it never be the lot of any , not even the basest murderer ! Worn out at last , in a lull of pain and terror , I fell into deep sleep , from which I was awakened by a hand upon my shoulder . I tried to look up , but could not . Sight was fled , and as I thought for ever . But I felt that it was a friend . "

CLARA VAUGHAN BOOK III . CHAPTER I. In the morning I dreamed of Isola . Across a broad black river , I saw her lovely smile . Thick fog rose from the water , in which two swans were beating a dog , and by snatches only could I see my darling . She waved her little hand to me , and begged me , with that coaxing smile which bent cast iron and even gold , to come across to Isola . In vain I looked for a boat , even in my dream I knew that I could not swim , and if I could , the lead upon my eyelids would have sunk me . So I called to her to come to me , and with that cry awoke . It was striking ten - my own little clock which my father gave me . I counted every stroke . What was Mrs. Shelfer doing , that she had not called me yet ? What was I doing , that I lay there so late ; for I always get up early ? And what was the sun about , that no light came into the room ? I knew it was ten in the morning . I felt all round . I was in my little bed , the splinter at the side of the head - board ran into my finger as usual . There I was , and nowhere else . Was it a tremendous fog ? If it was , they should have told me , for they knew that I liked fogs . At least they thought so , from the interest I felt . I groped for the little bell - pull , a sleezy worsted cord , which meant to break every time , but was not strong enough to do it . I jerked with all my strength , which seemed very little somehow . What a pleasure ! The bell rang like a fire - peal . I fell back on the pillow , exhausted , but determined to have it out with Mrs. Shelfer . I put my hands up to arrange my hair , to look a little more like Clara Vaughan , when the light should enter , and to frighten Mrs. Shelfer . There was something on my head . I never wear a night - cap ; my long black hair would scorn it . Am I in a madhouse , is this put to keep me cool ? Cold it is , and my brain so hot . All Wenham lake on Dives , and he will only hiss . While I am pulling at it , and find it streaming wet , in comes - I know her step - Mrs. Shelfer . But there is no light from the passage ! "

78832	79422	79423	79424	Young lady	1992	" I fell back upon my pillow , and could rise no more . The truth had been tingling through me , all the time she talked . I was stone - blind . I flung the bandage from me , and wished my heart would break . Mrs. Shelfer tried some comfort . She seemed to grieve for my eyelashes , more than for my eyes ; and addressed her comfort more to my looks than sight . Of course , I did not listen . When would the creature be gone , and let me try to think ? Poor little thing ! I was very sorry ; what fault was it of hers ? Who and what am I , blind I , to find fault with any one who means me well ? I drop my eyelids , I can feel them fall ; I lift them , I can feel them rise ; a full gaze , a side gaze , a half gaze ; with both eyes , with one ; it is all the same ; gaze there may be , but no sight . Henceforth I want no eyelids . The sun is on my face . I can feel his winter rays , though my cheeks are wet . What use is he to me ? I have the dagger somewhere by which my father died . Let me find it , if I can . I could have sworn that the box was in that corner carefully concealed . I strike against a washing - stand . Ah , now I have it ; the box is locked , my keys are in the top - drawer . I bear the box to the bed , and go groping for the chest of drawers . Already I can tell by the sun - warmth on my face , which way I am going . Surely , if I wait , I shall have the instinct of the blind . What care I for that ? The coward love of life suggested that poor solace . Now I have the keys . Quick unlock the box . At length I throw the cover back . The weapon handle is to the right . I stoop to seize it . I grasp a square of colour . Pretty instinct this ! I have got my largest drawing box . Oh paints , my paints , so loved but yesterday , that ape the colours I shall never see , my hot tears make you water - colours indeed ! If God has robbed my eyes of sight , He has not dried my tears . The gushing flood relieves me . What right have I to die ? Even without asking if my case be hopeless ! Who knows but what these lovely tints may glow for me again ? May I not once more intone the carmine damask of the rose , the gauzy green of April 's scarf ? Softening scenes before me rise . I lay my box of colours by , and creep into my bed for warmth . Presently the doctor comes . Inspector Cutting has chosen him , and chosen well . From his voice I know that he is a gentleman , from his words and touch instinctively I feel that he understands the case . When he has finished the examination he sees me trembling for the answer which I dare not seek . "

No thickening of the membrane can exclude that face . Inspector Cutting is still below ; I will send for him at once . Mrs. Shelfer remonstrates . "

79901	80042	79892	79893	Mrs. Shelfer	405	" I hear the Inspector 's step , not so heavy this time . He asks how I am , and expresses his sorrow . I feel obliged to him for not reminding me that the fault was all my own . Then I implore him , if he wishes me ever to see again , to tell me all he knows about the men I saw last night . Thus entreated , he can not refuse me , but first looks up and down the stairs , as I know by the sound of his steps ; then he shuts the door of the sitting - room . All he knows is not very much . They are refugees , Italian refugees ; two political and two criminal exiles , leaders now of a conspiracy to revolutionize their country . "
80052	80143	80145	80146	Inspector Cutting	423	" Simply because he has no right . As for the political refugees , of course , we never meddle with them ; as for the two criminals , they have not been demanded by their Government . Wonderful now , is n't it ? The two fellows who have committed murder their Government would not give sixpence for them ; but the two men who have only spouted a little , it would give a thousand pounds for either of them . He ca n't understand such a system . "
80211	80227	80190	80190	I	0	" Would he be afraid to arrest them ? He said they were desperate men . "
80228	80305	80341	80341	him	2422	" He should rather hope he would n't . They had got their knives , and pistols , and all that humbug . But it was more show than fight . They were desperate men in a private quarrel , particular when they could come round a corner , and when women were concerned ; but as for showing honest fight , he would sooner come across three of them , than one good Irish murderer .

80348	80409	80410	80410	He	2422	" Well , his proof was very little . In fact it was no proof at all as yet . But he was not like a juryman . He was quite convinced ; and his eyes should never be off that man , until he had him under warrant , and the whole case clear . Would that satisfy me ? "

80609	80617	80682	80683	Inspector Cutting	423	" Why did he take me thither ? "
80618	80669	80670	80670	I	0	" For excellent reasons . As to the one , it was most important that I should always know him again . Moreover , it saved my energies from waste . As to the other three , he had his own reasons for requiring an intelligent witness about their proceedings . "

80936	81041	80925	80926	Mrs. Shelfer	405	" She smiled so bootiful , when I opened the door , Miss , it fetched out all my hair pins ; and when I told her you was ill in bed , and struck stone blind along of some chemical stuff , two big tears came out of her long blue eyes , same as the wet out of a pennorth of violets , Miss ; and as for stopping her , she threw her muff at me , and told me to stop that if I liked , and to run and tell you that she was coming , quick , quick ! "
81051	81061	81048	81048	I	0	" cried the cheery voice I loved so well . "
81070	82103	81064	81064	Clara	300	" The little darling flung her soft warm arms around me , utterly forgetful of her dress , forgetful of all the world , but that little bit of it she held . Her delicious breath came over my fevered cheek , her cool satin flesh was on my burning eyelids . What lotion could be compared to this ? How long she stayed , I can not tell ; I only know that while I heard her voice , and felt her touch , blindness seemed no loss to me . She pronounced herself head nurse ; and as for doctors , what were they , compared to her own father ? If she could coax him , he should come next day , and deliver his opinion , and then the doctor might betake himself to things he understood , if indeed he understood anything , which she did not believe he did , because he had said she was not to come . My drawings too she admired , much more than they deserved , and her brother Conrad must come and see them , he was so fond of drawing , and there was nothing he could not do . She was so sorry she must go now , but old Cora must be tired of patroling , and she herself had a lecture to attend upon the chemical affinity of bodies . What it meant she had no idea , but that would not matter the least ; some of the clever girls said they did , but she would not believe them ; it took a man , she was sure , to understand such subjects . She would bring her work the next day , such as it was , and the nicest bit of sponge that was ever seen , it could not be bought in London ; and she would answer for it I should be able to paint her likeness in a week ; and she would not go till it was dark ; and then the Professor should come for her when his lectures were over , and examine me ; he knew all about optics , and retinas , and pencils of light , and refraction and aberration , and she could not remember any more names ; but she felt quite certain this was a case of optical delusion , and nothing else . How I wished I could have seen her , when she pronounced this opinion , with no little solemnity . She must have looked such a sage ! The thought of that made me laugh , as well as the absurdity of the idea . But I only asked how the Professor was to examine my eyes , if he did not come till dark . To be sure ! She never thought of that . What a little goose she was ! But she would make him come in the morning , before his work began ; and then old Cora would fetch her home to tea . And she had very great hopes , that if she could only persuade her papa to deliver a lecture in my room , it would have such an effect on my optic nerves , that they would come all right directly , at any rate I should know how to treat them . Delighted with this idea , she kissed me , and hugged me , and off she ran , after telling me to be sure to keep my spirits up , and the bandage not too tight . The latter injunction was much easier to obey than the former . She had enlivened me wonderfully , as well as nursed me most delicately ; but now that she was gone , the usual reaction commenced . Moreover , although as the saying is , the sight of her would have been good for sore eyes , the effort at seeing her , which I could not control , when she was present , was , I already felt , anything but good for them . And the loss , when she was gone , was like a second loss of light . Light ! What million thoughts flash through me at that little word ! Swiftest thing the mind has met , too like itself to understand . Is it steed or wing of mind ? Nay , not swift enough for that . Is it then the food of life , prepared betimes ere life appeared , the food the blind receive but can not taste ? If so , far better to be blind from birth . Well I know the taste from memory ; shall I never taste it else ? Has beauty lost its way to me ? The many golden folds of air , the lustrous dance of sunny morn , the soft reclining of the moon , the grand perspective of the stars long avenue to God 's own home , are these all blank to me , and night made one with day ? Oh God , whose first approach was light , replenisher of sun and stars , whence dart anew thy gushing floods solid or liquid we know not , whose subtle volume has no bourne or track ; light , the dayside half of life , leaping , flashing , beaming ; glistening , twinkling , stealing ; light ! Oh God , if live I must , grudge me not a ray ! CHAPTER III . Low fever followed the long prostration to which the fear of outer darkness had reduced my jaded nerves . This fever probably redeemed my sight , by generalizing the local inflammation , to which object the doctor 's efforts had been directed . Tossing on my weary bed , without a glimpse of anything , how I longed for the soft caresses and cool lips of Isola ! But since that one visit , she had been sternly excluded . The Professor had no chance of delivering his therapeutic lecture . In fact he did not come . "
82108	82120	81064	81064	Clara	300	" said Dr. Franks , when he heard of that proposal , "
82255	82269	82281	82281	me	0	" It sounded very hard , but I felt that he was right . "
82374	82375	82356	82357	Mrs. Shelfer	405	" "

82560	82674	82675	82677	Such a pair	2452	" He most kindly sent us both the boxes that very day ; and many a weary hour they lightened of its load . Poor Isola came every day to inquire , and several times she had her brother with her . She made an entire conquest of Mrs. Shelfer , who even gave her a choice canary bird . I was never tired of hearing the little woman 's description of her beauty , and her visit to the kitchen formed the chief event of the day . Mrs. Shelfer who had Irish blood in her veins used to declare that the ground was not good enough for them to walk on . "
82731	82732	82733	82733	You	2453	" "
82746	82747	82736	82737	Mrs. Shelfer	405	" "
82768	83390	82755	82757	my good friend	5901	" Exactly so . There lay all the difference to me , but none to any other . This set me moralising in my shallow way , a thing by no means natural to me , who was so concentrated and subjective . But loss of sight had done me good , had turned the mind 's eye inward into the darkness of myself . I think the blind , as a general rule , are less narrow - minded than those endowed with sight . Less inclined , I mean , to judge their neighbours harshly , less arrogant in exacting that every pulse keep time with their own . If eyes are but the chinks through which we focus on our brain censoriousness and bigotry , if rays of light are shafts and lances of ill will ; then better is it to have no crystalline lens . Far better to be blind , than print the world - distorted puppets of myself . I , that smallest speck of dust , blown upon the shore of time , blown off when my puff shall come ; a speck ignored by moon and stars ; too small however my ambition leap for earth to itch , whate'er I suck ; and yet a speck that is a mountain in the telescope of God ; shall I never learn that His is my only magnitude ; shall I wriggle to be all in all to my own corpuscle ? CHAPTER IV . Is there any Mocha stone , fortification agate , or Scotch pebble , with half the veins and mottlings , angles , flux and reflux , that chequer one minute of the human mind ? Was ever machine invented to throw so many shuttles ? At present I am gauged for little threads of thought - two minutes since , the smallest thing I could think of was myself . Now it is the largest . Must I grope from room to room , shall I never be sure where the table is , where my teacup stands ; never read , or write , or draw ; never tell when my hands are clean , except by smelling soap ; never know though small the difference how my dress becomes me , or when my hair is right ; never see my own sad face , in which I have been fool enough to glory , never - and this is worst of all - never catch another 's smile ? Here am I , a full - grown girl , full of maiden 's thoughts and wonderings , knowing well that I am shaped so but to be a link in life ; must I never think of loving or of being loved , except with love like Isola 's ; sweet affection , very sweet ; but white sugar only ? When my work is over , and my object gained , when my father 's spirit knows the wrong redeemed , as a child I used to think I would lay me down and die . But since I came to woman 's fulness , since I ceased to look at men and they began to look at me , some soft change , I know not what , has come across my dream . Is my purpose altered ? Is my tenor broken ? Not a whit of either . Rather are they stronger set and better led , as my heart and brain enlarge . Yet I see beyond it all , a thing I never used to see , a glow above the peaks of hate , a possibility of home . "
83392	83669	82755	82757	my good friend	5901	" I should have said , for now what have I to do with seeing ? On the fourteenth morning , I had given up all hope . They told me it was bright and sunny ; for I always asked about the weather , and felt most cruelly depressed upon a sunny day . By this time I had learned to dress without Mrs. Shelfer 's aid . Still , from force of habit I went to the glass to do my hair , and still drew back , as far as was allowed , the window curtain . Off with my wet bandage , I am sick of it ; let me try no longer to delude myself . Suddenly a gleam of light , I am sure of it ; faint indeed , and like a Will of the Wisp ; but I am quite sure it was a gleam of light . I go nearer the window and try again . No , there is no more for the present , it was the sudden change produced it . Never mind ; I know what I have seen , a thing that came and cheated me in dreams ; this time it has not cheated me ; it was a genuine twinkle of the sun . I can do nothing more . I can not put another stitch upon me . I am thrilling with the sun , like Memnon . I fall upon my knees , and thank the Father of light . When the Doctor came that day , and looked into my eyes , he saw a decided change . "
83697	83743	83767	83768	Miss Valence	435	" I laughed , and wept , and , blind as I was , could hardly keep from dancing . Then I wanted to kiss the Doctor , but hearing Mrs. Shelfer 's step , made a reckless jump and had it out upon her . "

When Isola came on the Thursday , and I obtained some little glimpse of her , she expressed her joy in a thousand natural ways , well worth feeling and seeing , not at all worth telling . I loved her for them more and more . I never met a girl so warm of heart . Many women can sulk for days ; most women can sulk for an hour ; I believe that no provocation could have made Isola sulky for two minutes . She tried sometimes at least she said so , but it was no good . And yet she felt as keenly as any of the very sulkiest women can do ; but she had too much warmth of heart and imagination to live in the folds of that cold - blooded snake . Neither had she the strong selfishness , on which that serpent feeds . In the afternoon , as we still sat together , in rushed Mrs. Shelfer with her bonnet on , quite out of breath , and without her usual ceremony of knocking at the door . I could not think where she had been all the day ; and she had made the greatest mystery of it in the morning , and wanted to have it noticed . Up she ran to me now , and pushed Isola out of the way . "

Charley has seen them do it ever so many times , and he says it 's bootiful , and they do n't mind giving five shillings a piece for them , when they are scarce . "
85011	85031	85067	85067	she	435	" Did Mr. Shelfer ever try them ? His eyes are so sharp : perhaps that is the reason . "
85032	85062	85067	85067	she	435	" No . I never heard that he did , Miss. But bless you he never tells me half he does ; no , nor a quarter of half . "

85098	85150	85081	85081	she	435	" Then when he comes home , Mrs. Shelfer , pop one of these shells , a good big one , into each of his eyes ; and let us know the effect to - morrow morning , and I 'll give you a kiss , if you do it well . "
85162	85208	85155	85155	Isola	480	" Lor , Miss Idols , bless your innocent heart , do you suppose he would let me ? Why he thinks it a great thing to let me tie his shoe , and he wo n't only when he has had a good dinner . "
85209	85212	85214	85214	Isola	480	" Well , "
85216	85252	85214	85214	Isola	480	" I am astonished ! Catch me tying my husband 's shoes ! I shall expect him to tie mine , I know ; and he shall only do that when he is very good . "
85271	85333	85267	85268	Mrs. Shelfer	405	" Lor , Miss , it 's all very well for girls to talk ; and they all does it , till they knows better . Though for the likes of you , any one would do anything a most . Pray , Miss Idols , if I may make so bold , how many offers of marriage have you received ? "
85334	85428	85155	85155	Isola	480	" Let me think ! Oh I know ! it 's one more than I am years old . Eighteen altogether , Mrs. Shelfer ; if you count the apothecary 's boy , and the nephew of the library ; but then they were all of them boys , papa 's pupils and that , a deal too young for me . They were all going to die , when I refused them ; but they are all alive so far , at any rate . Is n't it too bad of them ? "
85429	85475	85155	85155	Isola	480	" Well , Miss Idols , if you get as good a husband as you deserve , and that is saying a deal , he 'll tie your shoe may be for a month , and then he 'll look for you to tie his . "
85476	85504	85267	85268	Mrs. Shelfer	405	" And long he may look , even if he has shellfish in his eyes . Why look , Mrs. Shelfer , they 're all crawling about ! "
85505	85640	85155	85155	Isola	480	" Bootiful , is n't it ? Bootiful ! I wish Miss Valence could see them . And look at the horns they goes routing about with ! How they must tickle your eyelids . And what coorious eyes they has ! Ah , I often think , Miss Idols , I likes this sort of thing so much , what a pity it is as I was n't born in the country . I should never be tired of watching the snails , and the earywigs , and the tadpoles . Why , I likes nothing better than to see them stump - legged things come to table in the cabbage . I have not seen one now for ever so long . Oh that Charley , what dreadful lies he do tell ! "
85641	85648	85155	85155	Isola	480	" What about , Mrs. Shelfer ? "
85649	85814	85267	85268	Mrs. Shelfer	405	" Why , my good friend , he says them green things with stripes on , and ever so many legs , turns to live butterflies , after they be dead . But I was too many for him there . Yes , yes . The last one as I boiled , I did not say a word about it to him , but I put it by in a chiney - teacup , with the saucer over , in case it should fly away . Bless your heart , young ladies , there it is now , as quiet as anything , and no signs of a butterfly . And when he tells me any lies , about where he was last night , I just goes to the cupboard , and shows him that ; and never another word can he say . And so , Miss Valence , you wo n't try these little snails , after my journey and all ! "
85815	85873	85267	85268	Mrs. Shelfer	405	" Of course I wo n't , Mrs. Shelfer . But I am sincerely obliged to you for your trouble , as well as for all your kind nursing , which I can never forget . Now let me buy those shellfish from you , and Miss Isola will take them as a present to her papa . "
85874	85927	85155	85155	Isola	480	" No , no , unless he will put them in his eyes , Miss. I wo n't have them wasted . Charley will sell them again in no time . He knows lots of sailors . Most likely he 'll get up a raffle for them , and win them himself . "
86067	86091	86063	86063	she	2489	" Oh , I am so vexed . I have brought him to the door ; and now he wo n't come in ! "
86092	86098	86054	86054	her	2489	" Who , my darling ? "
86099	86128	86054	86054	her	2489	" Why , Conny , to be sure . My brother Conrad . I had set my heart on showing him to you , directly you could see . "
86129	86137	86063	86063	she	2489	" Why wo n't he come in ? "
86138	86185	86054	86054	her	2489	" Because he thinks that you ought not to see strangers , until you are quite well . He has not got to the corner yet . I can run like a deer . Send word by me , that you are dying to see him . "
86186	86199	86054	86054	her	2489	" Not quite that . But say how glad I shall be . "
86200	86214	86054	86054	her	2489	" I 'll say that you wo n't get well till you do . "
86215	86230	86054	86054	her	2489	" Say what you like . He will know it 's only your nonsense . "

It would be impertinence for me to tell you the reason . It is a domestic matter . I trust you will believe me , that no light reason would make me rude . May I come again with Isola , to see your drawings soon ? "

Pappy , you can lecture by the hour upon isothermic laws , and fluids , and fibrine , and adipose deposits , and you ca n't tell how long it took to set this delicate fat . I 'll tell you what it is , Pappy , if you ever snub me in lecture again before the junior sophists , as you dared to do yesterday , I 'll sing out , ' Ham , Pappy , ham !

Something you must have learned , or you would not have done what you did . All along I have felt that you were hiding something from me . Now you can have no motive . Now I am your successor in the secret ; I , and no one else . To no other will I commit the case . How much I have suffered from your secresy , none but myself can know . Henceforth I will have no help . Three months you have been on the track , and I almost believe that you have discovered nothing . "
89694	89755	89690	89690	his	2557	" You shall suffer no more . I had good reasons for hiding it , one of them your own hastiness . Now I will tell you all I know . In fact , as you well said , it has become my duty to do so , unless you will authorise me to appoint a successor before I go . "
89756	89772	89950	89950	his	2558	" Certainly not . My confidence in you can not be transferred to a stranger . "
89773	89811	89678	89678	His	2557	" One chance more . Let me report the matter officially . It is possible that my superiors may think it more important than my new mission , which is to recover a large amount of property . "

I feel once more that it is my destiny to unravel this black mystery ; myself , by my own courage . In asking your aid I was thwarting my destiny . Since then I have had nothing but accidents . There is a proverb in some language , ' Who crosses destiny shall have accident . ' "

He is only a serjeant as yet , and not in the detective force ; but he has qualities , that young man has , he has got all my abilities , and more ! Ah , he will be at the top of the tree when I am in my grave , please God . "

You are younger than me , I believe , in spite of all your stories ; and you are old enough in your ways , for old mother Hubbard that lived in a cupboard . Oh my tippets and furbelows , if I wore as tall as you , and half as long in the waist , what a dress I would have . Fifteen guineas at least . Come along , you bed - ridden dump of a Clara ; it 's freezing like bricks and silica , and I am in such spirits , and Giudice is frightening Tom out of his life in the kitchen . "

Giudice was in the kitchen , with Tom , from the top of the coffee - mill , sputtering anathemas at him . A magnificent dog he was , of the race of Maltese bloodhounds , now so scarce , fawn - coloured , long in the flank , deep in the jowl , pouch - eared , and grave of eye . He regarded Tom no more than if he had been an old hat brushed the wrong way ; and the birds , who were all in a flutter , he took for British butterflies . He came leisurely to me , walking one side at a time , and solemnly deposited his great moist nose in my hand . I knew him then as the friend who addressed me , long since , in the Villa Road . "

94497	94723	94272	94273	Mrs. Shelfer	405	" Why a nasty stinking hussy , that would steal the feathers out of my best bed again , the same as they did before . My very best bed , Miss Idols , as dear Miss Minto left me by her will , not a better bed in London , unless it 's the Queen 's , and so I used to tell her when I helped to shake it up . My mouth watered over it so , that she said one day , and the knife - boy heard her on the stairs , ' Patty , you 've been a good girl to me , and you deserves it , and you shall have it , when I am tucked up for good and all . ' And so I did , very honourable , and all above board . Yes , yes ; I had a commercial gent one time , a wonderful heavy man to be sure , and he stayed with me three year for the sake of that same bed . And he knew what beds was , and no mistake . It was bootiful to see when he was a getting up . It began to rise up , up , the same as Tom 's back , when he see your dog , Miss Idols . "

You could n't put your fist into one side of it , but out it would come the other . Oh Lor , I could cry ; that nasty sly minx , she was softer than parsnips , you 'd say , and one leg more than the other . I could n't think why it was she would always make her own bed . ' Thank you , Mrs. Shelfer ' - with her lips sucked in like a button - hole - ' thank you , you are too kind . It does n't at all fatigue me , and my doctor pronounces the exercise good for my chest and arms . ' Thank God , she got some exercise good for her legs as well . Six months on the treadmill . Charley got me an order , and it did my heart good to see her . But my twenty pounds of best feathers never came back again , and that was n't the worst of it neither . "

94939	94951	94937	94937	Idols	483	" the worst of it was the sin , Mrs. Shelfer . "
94952	94981	94411	94411	her	337	" The worst of it was that she stuffed it with sawdust , and oakum , and jovanna , I do believe , by the smell of it . "

95034	95097	94411	94411	her	337	" Sneaked them out of the house in the crown of her bonnet , and sold them at eightpence a pound , and they worth three and sixpence , every flue of them . But the rag and bottleman got two months , thank God for it . Ah , it will never be a bed again under 5 l. at least . "
95098	95110	94411	94411	her	337	" Is it the one I sleep on , Mrs. Shelfer ? "
95111	95122	94411	94411	her	337	" Yes , my good friend , the very same . "

95144	95317	94411	94411	her	337	" No , no , my good friend , wait a bit . We got most of that out again , and gave it to our geraniums . She stole it out of a sack as Charley kept in the washhouse . There was feathers in it . That put it into her head , I suppose . But as for your going , Miss Valence , that will never do . Never , never . Will it now , Miss Idols ? And to see her dress , to be sure , that baggage ! Why , my best tarlatan , as dear Miss Minto give me to be married in , was n't good enough for her to sweep the stairs in . Sweep the stairs - yes , yes , she did sweep the stairs when I see her last ; and she had afore , I know ; she was so clever at it ; and that was why one leg was so much more than the other . "
95318	95333	94411	94411	her	337	" Mrs. Shelfer , do you expect us to listen to you all night ? "
95334	95387	95389	95389	she	2671	" True , my good friend , quite true . But when I thinks of my feathers , something comes over me , I must out with my troubles , or burst . But you musn't go , Miss Valence . That will never do , never ; ask Miss Idols now . "
95403	95539	95389	95389	she	2671	" Of course it wo n't , Mrs. Shelfer . You are quite right , my good friend . I wo n't hear of it for a moment . Why Mr. Shelfer was drunk . I know it by the way he held his pipe . Quite ' drunk and incapable , ' you know . And he will be so sorry , and he 'll never do it again . And he did not mean to be drunk at all , but the frost was very hard , and the cold got into his head . I am sure it would into mine , if I had stayed much longer ; and he did n't understand brandy - balls , as we do at College - you could not expect it , you know . "
95622	95664	95615	95615	She	2673	" Bless your innocent heart , Miss Idols , if you do n't marry a king ! Not one of us is good enough to tie your shoes as you talked of , you are that simple and good of heart . "
95721	95730	95732	95733	Mrs. Shelfer	405	" To - morrow morning , Miss Valence , "
95736	95789	95732	95733	Mrs. Shelfer	405	" to - morrow morning , after I have wigged him well all night , and then given him a good breakfast , he 'll come and beg your pardon like a child , and be ashamed to look any higher than your flounces ; and I know you 'll forgive him . "
95790	95809	95732	95733	Mrs. Shelfer	405	" Mrs. Shelfer , I have forgiven him long ago . I can not bear enmity against such people "
95820	95900	95901	95901	Hereon	2677	" for such little wrongs . And I owe you a great deal for all your kindness to me . The only question is , whether self - respect and prudence allow me to stay here . I will leave the decision to Miss Isola . Young as she is , and innocent and confiding , she can not be wrong on a question of delicacy . As for prudence , she knows more of London than I do . "
96011	96141	95997	95997	She	2573	" Miss Valence and Mrs. Shelfer , since you have honoured my weak judgment by appointing me umpire , and as I am led to believe without any right of appeal , I will do my utmost to be discreet and impartial . In the first place I award that Miss Valence remain in this house , forget and forgive her wrongs . In the second place I recommend in such a matter I will not presume to command that till Mr. Shelfer has made a humble apology and promised faithfully never to be intoxicated again , however cold the weather is , Mrs. Shelfer shall not permit him to have a single kiss , nor a single bit of hot dinner . Now I have delivered my decree . "
96142	96191	96218	96218	he	490	" Lor , Miss Idols , you are too soft for the Old Bailey . He never kiss me , unless it is when he knows I have got some money . But he do like a good hot dinner . Right enough there , my good friend . "

101247	101738	101242	101242	Giudice	490	" A whistle and the last sound of the foot , for which I listened now by the hour . This thought was continually with me . It poisoned half the flavour and ruined all the digestion of my happy moments . But what could I do ? How unmaidenly , how presumptuous of me to imagine that he was likely to break his heart for me ! And if he did - why then he should break my own as well . I am not one of the drawing - room young ladies , who receive a modified proposal every Sunday afternoon , and think much more about the sermon afterwards . I can not play with the daffodils upon the brink of love , sleepily thrusting my admirers in , and lounging with half - open breast , which neither love - knots may secure , nor fluttering sighs unzone . No , here I am , such as I am , such as God has made me . No usury , no auction for my heart : once for all I give it , and my life goes with it . So it must always be with a girl of any feeling , who has trained her own existence . But for my wild ignorance , I would dare to say - so it must be always with a girl of feeling , twist and warp her as you will . Yet I am told , by those who know the world , that it is not so with nine girls out of ten among the lady caste . If , beneath the roc of fashion , they prefer the diamond to the meat , let them have it , and starve thereon . The choice is of their own young crops . No parent bird can force the bauble down . But what have I to do with this ? All I know is that neither I , nor any child of mine , will or shall be gulleted thus for life . After every little burst of thought , every feeble sally of imagination , came as always is the case with me came the slow pusillanimous reaction . All that I had any right to do was to paint , earn money , and be off for Italy . Little as I knew about the expense of travelling , I felt sure that it would be vain to start with less than a hundred pounds . Enormous sum ! How could I ever hope to win it , though I painted day and night , and lived on bread and water . To this diet , or what in London is quite synonymous , bread and milk , I had already reduced myself , in my stern resolve to lay by two pounds every week . Farewell to meat , so soon as my Devonshire "
101740	101767	101242	101242	Giudice	490	" was gone , and farewell to what I cared much more about , a glass of good London stout . I suppose there is something horribly "
101769	101782	101242	101242	Giudice	490	" in my tastes , for I will confess that the liquid called "
101785	101825	101242	101242	Giudice	490	" by Mr. Dawe had much charm for me . However , I abjured it with all other luxuries , and throve no whit the worse . The kindly little woman , whose summum bonum next to her ' sticks "
101844	102076	101838	101838	I	0	" Why , Miss Valence , you are the queerest young lady as ever I set eyes on . All as ever I see , and I 've see'd a many , they picks a little bit so dainty , like a canary cracking a hemp seed when the gentlemen is by : then off they goes when there 's nobody looking , and munches like so many pigs in a potato bury . Miss Violante you know . But as for you , why bless me and keep me , you feeds that great horse of a dog with all the fat of the land , and you lives on a crust yourself . Now do come down , that 's a good soul ; there 's a clod of beef a - biling with suet dumplings , and such lovely parsnips , you can smell it all up the stairs , galloping , galloping , my good friend , and that rogue of a Charley wo n't come home I know , he 's got along with that thief Bob Ridley ; and I expects the boy every minute with a little drop of stout , and the best pewter pot for you . Now if you wo n't come down , Miss Valence , my dinner will all stick in my throat , and I am so hungry . "

102997	103135	102939	102939	she	405	" Why a big beef marrow bone , that long , full of sovereigns and guineas after dear Miss Minto . I stopped it with a bung and a piece of bladder , and for better than a twelvemonth , while they was executing her will , I slept with that beneath my pillow for fear the priest should get it . Lord , how they did fight over the poor old lady 's rags and bones , that leathery priest and three yellow kites of cousins , they said they was , as come from Portugal . At last they got a ministration with the testament and text , and they robbed me shameful , shameful , my good friend . Never catch me going to mass again , or you may tell me of it . "
103144	103156	103161	103161	she	2838	" And what became of the marrow bone , Mrs. Shelfer ? "
103174	103322	103161	103161	she	2838	" Oh what a thief that Father Banger was , to be sure ! You see , Miss , I had strict orders to shut him out , when Miss Minto was near her end , because he had kicked her dear cat Filippina from the top of the stairs to the bottom , after he had gived her unction . What a pretty sight it was to see them seven dear cats , all sitting round the fire , each one on his proper stool with his name done on it in different coloured worsted . I had so much a year left me on the Bank of England , honourable to the day , for each one of those cats , and change of diet every week , and now there 's only one of them left , and that is my dear old Tom . "
103323	103334	103161	103161	she	2838	" But , Mrs. Shelfer , about the marrow bone - "
103335	103584	103161	103161	she	2838	" Well , my good friend , I was going to tell you . The way that Father Banger got into the house again to steal the poor old lady 's money , for building a school or some such villany . He knowed how fond the poor soul was of cats , so he borrowed a cat somewhere , and he got two boys to let it down the area with a whipcord round its stomach , and to jerk , jerk , jerk away at it , and the poor thing did squeal sure enough . ' Pain , Patty , ' says my poor mistress , and she could hardly speak - ' Oh , Patty , there 's some cruel Englishman torturing a cat again . ' So out I runs into the area , and in pops Father Banger , who had his back to the wall , with a great sheet of paper ; and he begins to make a list of all the things in the house . I took the cat to dear Miss Minto , and how pleased she was ! ' Please God , ' says she , ' to let me live a few days more till I make a Catholic of this poor heretic ' - she always converted her cats the first thing - ' and then it shall have a stool and a good annuity . ' But next day the poor thing went . "
103669	103715	103659	103660	Mrs. Shelfer	511	" Oh do n't , my good soul , oh do n't ! How can you ? Let us live , Miss Valence , let us live while we can , and not think of such dreadful things . You make my blood run cold . "
103716	103731	103659	103660	Mrs. Shelfer	511	" But , Mrs. Shelfer , surely you know that we all must die . "
103732	103812	103659	103660	Mrs. Shelfer	511	" Of course , my good friend , of course . But then you need n't remind one of it . I met Doctor Franks to - day , and he said , ' Why , Mrs. Shelfer , I do declare , you look younger than ever , ' and a very clever man he is , yes , yes ; and not a gray hair in my head , and my father lived to eighty - eight . "
103813	103825	103659	103660	Mrs. Shelfer	511	" And how old are you , Mrs. Shelfer , now ? "
103826	103866	103869	103871	poor little thing	6474	" Oh I am sure I do n't know , Miss Valence , I do n't keep no account . Let us talk of something else . Did you hear what Tom did to your Judy to - day ? "
103956	103960	103952	103952	Barton	371	" papper scrawl , "
103997	104480	104481	104484	DEAR MISS CLARA DEAR	300	" as the farmer himself expressed it . Therefore I was not surprised at receiving , instead of a letter by post , a packet delivered by the parcels van . This packet was bound round like the handle of a whip . and stuck at either end with a mass of cobbler 's wax . bearing the vivid impress of a mighty thumb . Within the wrappings first appeared an ominous crumpled scroll . Ye stars , where angels so buffooned by eminent painters dwell ! Once more I behold Eli on the turnpike gate , the Great Western steamer , Job with a potsherd of willow - pattern plate , the Prodigal Son , and worse than all , that hideous Death and the Lady . Recklessly I tumble out all the rest of the packet . Three great bolts with silver clasps , three apostle spoons , two old silver salt - cellars marked W.H.J.H. , a child 's christening cup , a horn tobacco - stopper with a silver tip , an agate from the beach , a tortoise - shell knife with a silver blade , half a dozen coins and a bronze fibula found upon the farm , an infant 's coral , a neck - pin garnished with a Bristol diamond , a number of mother - of - pearl buttons and blue beads , and a mass of mock jewelry bought by the farmer from the Cheapjacks at Barum fair with the produce of his wrestling triumphs . Separate from the rest , and packed most carefully , were all but two of the trinkets I had sent as Christmas gifts for the family . Touched to the heart by all this loving kindness , I felt so ashamed of my paltry petulance at Eli , Jonah , and the rest , that I would not indulge in a peep at Sally 's letter , which came last of all , until I had starved myself for a day . That literary effort showed so much improvement , both in writing and in spelling , that any critic would have endorsed Mr. Huxtable 's conclusion that the gift must be in the family . A few words still there were of rather doubtful texture , but who can bind or bound the caprice and luxury of the English language ? Moreover , Sally 's stops were left once more to the discretion of the reader . But if Lord Byron could not grasp the mysteries of punctuation , how could Sally Huxtable ? Yet that eager little maid would have learned in half an hour the art which might have mellowed the self - tormentor 's howling . Sally 's was a healthy , sweet , and wholesome nature . Tossil 's Barton Farm , Trentisoe . The tenth day of March A.D. 1851 . "

107593	108359	107590	107591	SALLY HUXTABLE	383	" CHAPTER XIV . From Sally 's eager description of the coat and buttons , I concluded easily that a servant from Vaughan St. Mary had been sent in quest of me . My father hated showy liveries and loathed hair - powder , but Mr. Edgar Vaughan returned to the family usages , or rather allowed them to re - establish themselves ; for on such questions he was wholly indifferent . Now what could be his motive for sending so expressly to discover me ? I knew not , neither cared very greatly , but wrote at once to Tossil 's Barton , first to return their loving contribution , which consisted mainly of ancestral relics prized for generations , secondly , to set free the secret of my address . Into my own self I returned once more . Somehow I seem to expand whenever I come in contact with the yeoman 's family , and their lowly greatness . I am like a worm when it rains , after the drought of summer . Surely the God , who leaves us to stifle ourselves with the dust of fashion and convention , has His own gracious times to breathe upon and scatter it . At intervals we may see through the reek of our own exuding , and inhale a more bracing air than sleeps in mausoleums . But instead of being exalted and fed by the open breeze , we shudder at the draught and replace our respirators . I returned into myself , and found little comfort there . I do not live inside myself , as most people live in theirs . True , I am apt to resent any slight to it offered from the outside . True , I seek its keep and comfort in a mechanical sort of way . But as for crusting in its bottle , ripening in its husk , rusting in its watch - case , I have been too long the toy of wind and weather not to be turned inside out . Never can I moulder into the fungoid nucleus the British taste admires . And yet there is about me , if I must not say within me , a stanch cleaving , a cohesion , a concrete will , which is of genuine Anglo - Saxon fibre . So I thrust aside all dreams of Tossil 's Barton and Vaughan Park , and certain wilder sweeter dreams which have begun to flutter and thrill through me , and in earnest I return to my task of money - making . Giudice still is faithful , and comforts much my solitude . He has never asked his master 's leave or mine , he has never received any formal invitation , yet here he looks all at home , sleek and unblushing , though long since quite convalescent and equal to livery stable diet . Once indeed , as we passed the entrance , he pretended to me that his conscience pricked him . To ease it , he sniffed about , and halted just for a moment , then turned his nose up , recocked his tail , and trotted jauntily on . Since then he has always avoided that left side of the street . He is affable still to Isola , but clearly regards her as no more than a pleasant acquaintance . Whenever she enters the room , he walks from his corner with a stretch and a yawn , sniffs all round her dress , to learn where she has been , and what dogs she has spoken to ; then , in the absence of any striking discovery , he looks into her face with a grave complacence , and brings me his conclusion . Tom , and the birds , the squirrel , and the little marmoset Mrs. Shelfer 's newest and dearest pet , he gazes upon from a lofty standing as so many specimens of natural history , interesting so far , but otherwise contemptible . He is now allowed free run of the house , understands all the locks , and presents himself in every room at the proper meal - time . Even the little dress - maker is then honoured with his attentions . Everybody loves him , he is so gentle and clever and true . Back he comes to me , with his mouth rather greasy I must admit , gives me one kiss as a form , I am afraid , and exclaiming , "
108582	108619	108576	108576	I	0	" Although , lest I profane your hallowed part , Queen Nature chills the blood around my heart ; Sweet dog , permit me to indulge my dream Of country valleys , and the mazy stream . "
108726	108730	108731	108731	she	440	" Oh Donna , "
108734	108807	108731	108731	she	440	" what nonsense you do talk ! Obliged to us indeed ! I am sure we are all greatly obliged to you ; and many a stir it saves us at home , for the dog detests papa so ; and when Conrad comes to see us , he ca n't bear to have Judy shut out like a thief , and he the most honourable dog that ever wagged a tail . "
108808	108831	108839	108839	his	2995	" To be sure he is . You know you are , do n't you , oh combination of Bayard and Aristides ? "
108850	108892	108839	108839	his	2995	" But I have said all along that Conny should pay for his board , and he feels it too : but we could not tell how to propose it to you , dear Donna , you are so very outrageous . "
108893	108900	108839	108839	his	2995	" I should hope so indeed . "
108901	108924	108929	108929	her	440	" And then I am sure it would break poor Judy 's heart to go . Would n't it now , Judy ? "
108965	109108	108958	108958	he	490	" You know I am only a dog . But you , Clara , happen to be a human being ; and so you know all we dogs know , and ever so much besides . Only you ca n't smell . You can talk , as fast as you like , both to each other and to us , but we can talk to none except our fellow dogs . Now do n't take a mean advantage of me . I know that I was made only to be your servant , and I love you with all my heart , that I do . I ca n't tell at all where I shall go when I die , or if I shall go anywhere ; and I am sure I shall die , if you cast me away like this . "
109140	109148	109150	109150	his	2996	" And another thing , Clara dear , "
109155	109174	109150	109150	his	2996	" I consider him now more my dog than Conny 's . You know he was given between us "
109186	109204	109150	109150	his	2996	" and I only lent Conrad my half as long as he liked to pay for him . "

109601	109651	109597	109599	the senior sophist	2573	" as Conrad has owned all the dog so long , it is my turn to own every bit of him for an equal period , and I must pay you half a crown a week for his keep , and half a guinea for doctoring him so well . "
109681	109685	109686	109686	she	440	" Oh Donna , "
109689	109720	109686	109686	she	440	" you have no idea how fond dear Conny is of you . I am getting so jealous . He thinks much more of you than he does of me . "
109752	109800	109806	109806	she	440	" Why do n't you answer me , Clara ? Did you ever know such a shame ? Well , I do believe you like being admired every bit as much as I do , in spite of all your sublimity . Why there comes Conny himself ; "
109812	109852	109806	109806	she	440	" I thought so . I knew the ring of his heel . He will wear such clumsy boots , though his foot is as pretty as mine . I always know his step , and so does Judy . "
109874	109883	109885	109886	his sister	2499	" I will go and open the door , "
109888	109903	109885	109886	his sister	2499	" how rude he is to come when you are so busy , Clara . "

110324	110344	110321	110321	he	439	" I am grieved in my heart by hearing that you were not treated at all politely last night . "
110451	110457	110458	110458	I	0	" Oh , Mr. Ross , "
110461	110489	110458	110458	I	0	" I think nothing at all of that . A learned man like your father can not be expected to bear with every ignorant girl 's curiosity . "
110490	110520	110527	110528	Master Conrad	439	" To a lady 's love of knowledge every gentleman should administer and be gratified . All men of lofty science enjoy to meet with a gentle mind inquiring . "
110703	110724	110693	110693	He	439	" I am made certain that I have seen you long ago . I will think , I will think . "
110772	110791	110792	110792	He	439	" You will forgive me , Miss Valence , you know that I would not use a freedom . "
110811	110830	110831	110831	I	0	" You will think me the weakest in mind and most wicked , but I am most unhappy . "
110858	110921	110792	110792	He	439	" It is to me a disgrace to come to you with my troubles . But I do it from no unmanly temper . I do it alone for the sake of my precious sister Isola . I have no longer any one whom I dare to love but her , and now I am compelled to abandon her at the last . "
110922	110931	110842	110842	him	439	" Do you mean to be long away ? "
110946	111128	110933	110933	I	0	" I shall not be away from London , but I shall be departed from Isola . The house where she lives I am no more to visit . A long time I have gone there only a little , and alone to see her . She is ordered now to come no more to me . This day I spoke very violently . But I will not detain you with that . I will confess I did wrong ; but I was richly provoked . My object in burdening you is double : - First to implore you , if I may without using liberty , to endure well with the Professor , lest she should be interdicted from coming to visit you , and then she would have no one remaining to love her . Second to ask , a thing that I hesitate because I can not narrate to you all things , whether you would indulge me , if there is no wrong , to come now and then to see my own and my only sister . "
111129	111142	111248	111248	he	3029	" Of course you do not mean without her father 's knowledge . "
111143	111242	111243	111243	His	3029	" I would never insult you , Miss Valence , by asking a thing like that . I desire nothing of what you call clandestine . You are so free and open , you would never have to do with any sort of concealment . Neither am I in the habit to do anything like that . It has only been commanded that I may not go there , or invite her to come to my house . The Professor has great power in the present , but he does not pretend to interdict me from my sister . "
111282	111344	111345	111345	He	3029	" Only one more thing I will entreat of you , Miss Valence ; poor Isola has never learned what means any grief . If she is vexed by this , I pray you to sustain and comfort her ; for I shall never make a wrong advantage of your most kind permission , so as to see her very often . "
111606	111625	111626	111626	She	440	" Oh my good friend , look here ! I was never so frightened in all my life . "

CHAPTER XVII . How vast the rooms appeared to me , how endless the main passages , after the dimensions long familiar at Tossil 's Barton , and Mrs. Shelfer 's . I even feared to lose the way , where my childish feet had measured every step . First I hurried to my own snug room , or rooms - for I had parlour and bedroom adjoining - in the western wing , where mother used to live . Everything there was in beautiful order , a lamp and a good fire lighted ; and Matilda Jenkins met me at the door . Directly after our departure for Devonshire , Mr. Vaughan had thought fit to discharge all the old servants , except the housekeeper and Matilda . They were all in league against him , for they could not bear that the "
115471	115571	115263	115263	I	0	" whom they had known so long , should be ejected . Moreover , his discipline was far more stern than ours ; for my father and mother had always ruled by love . The housekeeper , a great friend of mine , was retained from respect and policy , and poor Tilly who entered life through a dust - bin from contempt of her insignificance . By that time she had risen to the rank of scullery - maid and deputy dishwasher ; now she had climbed in the social scale to the position of under - housemaid . "

There was an inner door also , and the nurse did not seem very wakeful . Instead of knocking again , Matilda retreated hastily . At last the nurse appeared , and I found her to be a very respectable woman , who had been with my mother , through several attacks of illness . A dark suspicion , which I had scarcely confessed to myself , was partly allayed hereby . After whispering for a few moments , she led me into the dimly lighted room , and to my uncle 's bed . I started back in terror . Prepared as I was for a very great change , what I saw astounded me . The face so drawn and warped aside , withered and yet pulpy , with an undercast of blue ; the lines of the mouth so trenched and livid , that the screwed lips were like a bull's - eye in a blue diamond pane ; and the hair , so dark and curly when last I saw him , now shredded in patches of waxy gray . The only sign of life I saw , was a feeble twitching of the bed - clothes , every now and then . The poor eyes were closed , hard , and wrinkled round ; one wasted arm lay on the quilt , the hand bent up at the wrist , the fingers clutched yet flabby , and as cold as death . It was a sight for human pride to cower at , and be quelled . "

116758	116843	116755	116756	Mrs. Daldy	319	" Oh ! In a moment I saw the whole ; though it was too black for belief , blacker than any fever that festers the human heart . This was the purpose with which that woman had sent for me . She had lied to me as to the character of the disease . She had opposed me , because she knew it the surest way to urge me . She had brought me too at night , when fevers are doubly infectious . "
117022	117023	117024	117024	Jane	355	" "
117062	117063	117066	117066	Miss	3176	" "
117129	117333	117334	117334	Jane	355	" She led me into the dressing room ; but even there the same crawling creeping smell pervaded , as if a grave had been opened , when the ground was full of gas . Instead of talking to the nurse , I began to think . It broke upon me vaguely , that I had heard of some very simple remedy for a fever of this nature , and that my dear mother , who in her prosperous times was the village doctoress , had been acquainted with the case . But in the whirl of my brain , I could not bring to mind what it was . Oh what would I give , only to think of it now ! Though not , I am sorry to say , at all of a pious turn at least if Mrs. Daldy is so , in the strong feeling of the moment , I fell upon my knees , and prayed for help . So had my mother taught me , and Mother Nature taught me now . I will not be so daring as to say that my prayer was answered . Perhaps it was only that it calmed my mind . "
117342	117354	117334	117334	Jane	355	" Alas the bathos ! But I ca n't help it . "
117383	117384	117364	117364	They	3181	" "
117402	117417	117396	117396	I	0	" She stared , and hesitated ; but saw that I was in earnest . "
117512	117513	117496	117496	they	3181	" "
117562	117563	117549	117549	she	542	" "
117580	117581	117569	117569	she	542	" "
117597	117857	117588	117588	I	0	" After a few more words , Jane went her way stealthily , like a thorough - bred thief ; and I was left alone with my poor dying uncle . Wonderful as it seemed to me , I felt now a tender affection for him , I the resolute , the consistent , the bitter Clara Vaughan . Even if he had told me that moment , that he had plotted my father 's death , I would have perilled my life for his ; because I should have known that he was sorry . Yet I was full of cold fear , lest he should awake to consciousness , and utter that awful cry , while I alone was with him , in the dead hour of night . Sooner than I expected , the nurse came back with a jug of beautiful yeast , smelling as fresh as daybreak . We put it outside the window on the stone sill , to keep it cool and airy . She had seen no one except Matilda , who was waiting for me , and crying dreadfully , predicting my certain death , and her own too ; if she should have to attend me . She kept at a most respectful distance from Jane ; and , with all her affection , was glad to be clear of me for the night . For nearly two hours , the nurse and I sat watching , with hardly a spoken word , except that I asked one question . "
117869	117870	117871	117871	She	319	" "
117892	118087	117886	117886	she	319	" Broad awake at that strange hour , and in that strange way , I began to pass through the stereoscope of my brain the many strange slides of my life . Of all of these , the last for the moment seemed the strangest . Suddenly we heard a low feeble moan . Running into the bedroom , there we saw the poor sick one with his eyes wide open , vainly attempting to rise . I put my arms around him , and raised him on the pillow . He tried to say ' thank you , ' for he was always a gentleman in his manners ; then he gazed at me with hazily wondering eyes . Then he opened his mouth in a spasmodic way , and began that bitter cry . Ere he closed his mouth again , I poured well into his throat a table - spoonful of yeast , handed to me by Jane . To my great pleasure , it glided beyond the black tongue ; and I gave him two more spoonfuls , while he was staring at me with a weak and rigid amazement . "
118132	118486	118115	118115	he	3190	" As he lay thus in my arms , I felt that one side was icily cold , and the other fiery hot . His face looked most ghastly and livid , but there was not that mystical gray upon it , like the earth - shine on the moon , which shows when the face of man is death 's mirror , and the knee of death on man 's heart . In a minute he slid from my grasp , down on the pillow again , and , with a long - drawn sigh , became once more stiff and insensible . My hope was faint indeed , but still it was hope : if he had hope 's vitality , he might yet be saved . The rest of that night was passed by the nurse and myself in heavy yet broken sleep . Jane assured me that there was no chance of my poor uncle becoming conscious again , for at least six hours . I was loth to forego my watch , and argued that the dose we had given might cut short this interval ; but lo - while I kept repeating at weary and weary periods , that I could do no harm , since the physician gave up , and I might do good - sleep , the lover of repetition , laid his hand alike on my formula and myself . Dear Judy 's howl was in my dream , and Mrs. Shelfer 's never ceasing prattle . CHAPTER XVIII . Cold and fresh was the morning air , and the open window invited the sounds of country life . Who could think of fever with the bright dew sparkling on the lawn , the lilac buds growing fat enough to claim their right of shadow , the pleasant ring of the sharpening scythe , and the swishing sweep of the swathe ? From the stable - yard , round the corner , came the soothing hiss of the grooms , the short stamp of the lively steed I fancied I knew my own favourite "
118488	118493	118115	118115	he	3190	" , and the gruff "
118501	119336	118497	118497	mare	3191	" Far down the avenue whistled the cowboy , waddle - footed , on his way to the clover leys , or the milkmaid sung with the pail on her hip , and the deer came trooping and stooping their horns along . Was it not one of my own pet robins , who hopped on the window - sill , peered bravely at himself in the jug , and tried to remember the last of his winter notes ? But it is cold , Jane , very cold indeed ; and we have never been to bed ; and now the mowers have descried us , why do they stop their work , and shake their heads together so , and keep outside the ranunculus bed , and agree that the grass beneath our windows does not require cutting ? Why , if they were Papists , they would cross themselves , and that saves many an oath . But the grass does want cutting , Jane . It can not have been cut for a week . I will call to them . No , it might disturb my uncle . There is no sound from the bed - room yet : all deep and deadly silence . I will go and see . There my patient lies , just as when I saw him first , except that I have arranged the wreck of his hoary locks , and applied a lotion to his temple on the burning side . And yet , now I look closer , the face is not quite so livid ; or is it the difference between the candle - light and the morning ray ? Even while I looked , he started up , as if my eyes revived him . He did not moan or cry ; but opened wide his filmy eyes , and gazed feebly and placidly at me . For a time he did not know me : then a great change gradually crept through his long faltering gaze . Fearing the effects of excitement upon him , I tried to divert his attention by another good dose of yeast . Three times he took it with resignation like a well - trained child , but his eyes all the time intent on me . Presently they began to swim and swerve ; the effort of the faint blood - tissued brain and the exertion of swallowing had been too much for his shattered powers . He fell off again into the comatose state , but with a palpable difference . The pulse , which had throbbed on the hot side only , could now be felt most feebly moving in the other wrist , and the tension of the muscles was relaxed : circulation was being restored and balanced , and the breathing could now be traced , short as it was and irregular . I have not time to describe all the symptoms of gradual improvement , and I have not the medical knowledge needful to do so clearly . Enough that the six - hour interval was shortened that day by half , that the breathing became more regular , and a soft perspiration broke through the clogged and clammy pores . Jane wanted to second this by an additional blanket , but I feared to allow it in a case of so utter prostration . When the perspiration was over , then I prescribed the blanket for fear of a chill reaction . At every return of consciousness , our patient made an effort to speak , but I hushed him with my hand on his lips , and he even managed to smile , when he found that I would be obeyed . In the evening he tried to open his arms to me , and then tried to push me away , in some faint recollection of the nature of his disorder . To me the interest was so intense , and the delight so deep , that if I had lost him now , it would surely have broken my heart . At sunset of that day , as nurse and I sat near the dressing - room window , watching the slant rays flickering on the sward , and the rooks alighting and swinging over their noisy nests , a black cloud hung for a moment just above the sun , a black cloud with a vivid edge of gold . It tempered the light in a peculiar manner , and seemed to throw it downwards . Peering through my fingers at it , for it was very beautiful , I saw a whitish mist or vapour steaming and hovering above the disk of the setting sun , between my eyes and that golden marge . I wondered what this could be ; there was no heat to cause strong evaporation , nor any mist or dewy haze about , nor was the sun "
119340	119389	118497	118497	mare	3191	" But what I saw was like that trembling twinkle of the air , which we often observe on a meadow footpath in the hot forenoon of July . I drew Jane 's attention to it , not expecting any solution , but just for something to say . "

119450	119475	119440	119440	you	3192	" I was rather irritable , but vexed with myself for being so . Too much excitement and too little sleep were the causes . "

120356	120495	120340	120340	She	3223	" For the safety of the household , Mrs. Fletcher orders that the persons in the fever - room be allowed no communication with the other servants . The intercepting door is fastened , because a most sinful un - Christian act was perpetrated last night . Due supplies will be delivered once a - day , at 10 A.M. No empty vessels and no correspondence received . Any attempt to break these rules will be punished by suspension of supplies . Servants are forbidden to come beneath the sick - room windows .

But I struck my knuckles terribly against that stringing - course , and very nearly lost hold from the pain of the blow ; then bending my body forward I gave one good push at the wall , and shutting both eyes , I believe , let go the rope altogether . Backward I fell , and rolled over upon the feather bed . I was not even stunned , but feared for a moment to try if my limbs were sound . There I sat and stripped off the winding sheet . Presently , up I got , and , in my triumph , alas ! could not help crying "
121823	121941	121821	121821	Hurrah	549	" like a foolish little child . In a moment I saw that my cry had been heard , where it should not have been . A rapid flitting of lights along the lower windows and in the stableyard , and I knew that chase would be given . But after leaving my father 's house in such a dignified manner , was it likely that I would give in and be caught ? Now , Clara , you could beat all your nurses in running , off and away like the wind ! Away I went full speed towards the shade of the avenue , while Jane had the wit to scream out of the window , "
121953	122627	122628	122628	Tulip	539	" This made some little diversion ; I had a capital start , and it was but half a mile to the lodge where old Whitehead lived . Once there , I should care for nobody . I must have escaped very easily , for my feet seemed as swift as a deer 's ; but , as my luck would have it , the light iron gates between the lawn and the park were fastened . What on earth should I do ? I saw men running across the lawn , and , what was worse , they saw me . In vain I pulled at the gates ; they rattled , but would not yield . Had I owned true presence of mind , I should have walked boldly up to the men , and dared them to touch me fresh from the fever - room . In the flurry of the moment I never thought of that , but darted into the shrubbery , and crouched among thick laurels . Presently I heard them rush down the main drive and begin the search , with some heavy swearing . Two of them came to the very clump I was hiding in , and pushed a pitchfork almost into my side , but the stupid fellows had lanterns , which blinded them to the moonlight . On they went with grumblings and growlings , which told me exactly where to shun them . Judging at length , from the silence , that the search had passed to the right , I slipped from my tangled lair , and glided away to the left , beyond the shrubbery spring , where a little gate , as I knew , led to a glade in the park . The deep ha - ha which I had feared to jump in the dark , because of the loose stones at the bottom , was here succeeded by a high oak paling , and probably through that gate had come the murderer of my father . With a cold shudder at the remembrance , I stole along through the shadowy places , and had almost reached the little gate , when I saw two of the searchers coming straight towards me . To the right of me was the park - paling , on the left a breastwork of sod , which I could not climb without being clearly seen ; to fly was to meet the enemy ; should I yield , and be baffled after all ; insulted too , most likely , for I knew that the men were tipsy ? In my hand was the tightly - wound sheet , used as a rope to confine my dress . I had folded it short and carried it , on the chance of its proving useful . In a moment I was under the palings in deep shadow , with the white sheet thrown around me , falling from my forehead , and draped artistically over the right arm . Stock still I stood against the black boards , and two great coils of long black hair flowed down the winding sheet . The men came up , tired of the chase , and grumbling ; and by their voices I knew them for my good friends Jacob and Bob . Suddenly , they espied a tall , white figure , of tremendous aspect . They stopped short , both tongue and foot , and I distinctly heard their teeth chatter . With a slow and spectral motion , I raised my draped white arm , and fetched a low , sepulchral moan . Down fell the lantern , and , with a loud yell , away went the men , as hard as their legs could carry them . Laughing heartily , I refolded my sheet , and taking the short cut across the park to the lodge where old Whitehead lived , arrived , without having met even my old friend "
122630	122878	122628	122628	Tulip	539	" The old man , in hot indignation , drew forth his battered musket - for he had once been in the militia - and swore that he would march upon the - - rogues at once . Instead of that I sent him for the two Hiatts , and the village constable ; and soon , without invitation , half the village attended . With my torn dress tucked up by good Mrs. Whitehead , and a hat on my head , newly bought for her clean little grandchild , I set forth again in the moonlight , at the head of a faithful army , to recover my native home . Hiatt easily opened the gate , which had defied my flurried efforts , and we presented ourselves at the main entrance , a force that would frighten a castle . It is needless to say that we carried all before us . The state of siege was rescinded , Mrs. Fletcher and Tilly set free , all the ringleaders turned away neck and crop , and what was far more important , my poor uncle removed , without being conscious of it , to a sweet and wholesome room . The sturdy Gloucestershire yeomen scorned all idea of danger . Tired with all my adventures , before I slept that night - still near my uncle 's bed - two reflections came dreamily over my mind . The first was a piece of vanity . "

Before that week was over , my uncle could sit up in bed for a short time every day , being duly propped in a downy nest of pillows . One arm , however , remained quite impotent , and part of one side rigid and numb . His recovery was slow and tedious , as might well be expected with one who had been dragged not from the jaws but the very throat of death . For a long time also his mind was feeble and dim , a mirror overcast by the vapours of the body . To me , who am fond of observing , in my own little childish way , it was interesting as well as delightful to note how , day by day , the mind and body , hand in hand , rose stronger . More than all was I taught , and humbled in my own conceit , by taking heed how tardily came back the power to guide and control the imagination . That object - glass of the mind - not achromatic even in first - rate intellects - had long been out of the focal distance from the lens of reason 's eye . Upon it had been glancing loose distorted images , rendered home imperfectly , if at all , to the retina of the brain . Herein its state was the very opposite to that of my own phrenoscope . I have no large imagination ; but the images it presents are vivid , and I see well round them . Every one of them is not cast , but cut , on my sensorium . Whether I can strike them off in words - whether my telegraph can print its message - is quite another question , and beside its purpose . Having rendered home to me the idols oftentimes inverted , though distinct it leaves expression and judgment to do their best with the copyright . Now , both in fabric and in mould , my uncle 's mind was different . Naturally his powers were far superior , but he seemed to take no pride in them . No dark and settled purpose had ever thrown its shadow , and even its weight , upon them ; nor had they felt , so far as I knew , the rough grasp of adversity . Therefore they were longer in recovering from the blow , than I think my own would have been . There were few things , among the many desired by Mrs. Daldy , which she failed to reconcile with her strong sense of religion . "

From this it will be clear , that in her devotions she still remembered me , and doubtless prayed in good Scriptural phraseology for my release from this wicked world . Dr. Churchyard 's last report had raised her terror to the highest pitch , and instead of wrestling in prayer , she had run away in high panic , upon hearing that the fever - nurse was seen at large the night before . "
123719	123732	123748	123749	Mrs. Fletcher	534	" she said to Mrs. Fletcher , before she locked her in , "
123761	124690	123748	123749	Mrs. Fletcher	534	" It was wise , as well as righteous , in her to keep aloof for a time , while her devices worked their consummation . For the present it appeared to me that they were failing signally . My uncle was regaining strength of mind and body ; while native air , a sense of triumph , and daily exercise , kept me in blooming health . My patient , who otherwise could hardly bear me to leave him for an hour , insisted upon my taking a long ride every day . Lilla was charmed , and so was I , with the sweet spring air , and the rich familiar scenery . And how it did make me eat ! Thankful indeed I ought to be , and am , that it pleased God to spare me that awful and deadly pestilence . But the worst injury done by canting hypocrites is , that the repulsion they create drives away others from good . Truly I may say , that for days after being in contact with that slimy sanctity , I could not say my own prayers , as a little child should do . Of that fever there had been three fatal cases in the village , before it entered our house ; and I found that it was spreading rapidly . With my uncle 's authority , I had the drainage surveyed and amended at once ; and so the pest was stayed . Of course we did not neglect our own weak point ; and the crawling noisome smell was no longer perceived in the room , nor the white vapour on the grass . And so three weeks went by ; no news from London or Devonshire , no explanation between my uncle and myself , no arrangements as to my expectations in life . As yet my uncle was too weak to bear any sort of excitement , and seemed desirous only to be passive in my hands . His eyes always followed me to every part of the room , and he would even be propped on the sofa to see me ride down the avenue ; and there I always found him watching for my return . Meanwhile I yearned to be once more in a certain little room with a north aspect , opposite a cheesemonger 's shop in an obscure street of London . Nightly I dreamed of Giudice , and daily I dreamed of dear Isola and Conrad . The dog in the stableyard , who had hitherto owned no especial attractions for me , suddenly found himself petted , and coaxed , and fed which he thought much more of to the scandal of Mrs. Fletcher , and the great alarm of the grooms , who would rather not have me there . Moreover , the dog himself , though I strove to invest him with every chivalrous attribute , was of a low and ungenial order , adorned with no graces of mind , and little taste , except for bones and gravy . But perhaps my standard was too high : peradventure I even commenced with more prejudice than a bulldog 's . Be that as it may - and if I can see round things , I ought to see round myself - every day fell heavier and heavier from the fair balance of time ; and every night the stars - for there was now no moon - looked wearier in the heavens , and less inclined for business . How long , how long shall you go round the pole in your steady pacing way , as if the sky were for auction , and you were pacing the lots ; while I , with more fire in me than you can strike or steal , am ditched like a glow - worm kicked under a dock - leaf , and see no polestar at all ? Here is May , the height of May : I am full of life and spirit : the garb of death , like an April cloud , blows over . Let me see . Last birthday I was eighteen : I have known more troubles than years , and enjoyed no youth as yet . Last year I spent in growing , and pining , and starving . Now the Power , that balances earth and heaven , has filled me with joy and light . Neither am I renegade to my life , in opening wide my heart to this flood of love and happiness . Still am I set upon one strong purpose . Still am I sworn , and will not repent , that if filial duty demand it , I will trample love under my feet , and cut the throat of happiness . During most of this time , I had no idea where the queen of hypocrites was ; though doubtless she knew all that was happening to us . As soon as he heard of my uncle 's surprising rally , Dr. Churchyard came over , and claimed all the merit for his own last prescription . Brought face to face with the awkward fact that the medicine had not been procured , he was not in the least disconcerted , but found that we had misunderstood him , the prescription to which he referred was the one before the last . At any rate , he enhanced his own fame immensely , and became "
124694	125260	125261	125261	Tulip	539	" in killing more people than ever . In reply to Mrs. Fletcher , for I would not deign to ask him , he stated that the excellent and devoted Mrs. Daldy had not been seen lately in Cheltenham . Her son , however , was there , and foremost in the ranks of Pump - room Lady - killers . Just what he was fit for . The doctor entertained a belief , and spread the report in Cheltenham , that Dorcas was lodged in a humble cot among the haunts of pestilence , imperilling her life and lavishing her substance to relieve the fever - stricken . This being more than I could stand , I asked the worthy doctor - who , after all , was a man of the world - what three wealthy persons Dorcas had carried with her . At first he feigned not to understand me , then looked sly , and changed the subject cleverly . Of course I referred to the well - known fact , that she supported her grandeur and her son 's extravagance by playing an admirable rubber . She was playing a better one now . Dr. Churchyard finished by writing another prescription , which , after his departure , I handed to the husband of Venus , legitimate disposer of mineral medicines . CHAPTER II . London ! London ! was still the cry of my heart ; and was I not summoned thither by duty long ago ? What might become , during all this time , of the man whom I was bound to watch at every turn , and whom I was now in a better condition to deal with ? My first visit , every morning , was to my parents ' graves , and neither of them would be there but for his ruthless hand . As I sat there how lonely I felt ! how sadly forlorn in the world , be my lot wealth or poverty , victory or defeat ! One morning as I sat there my spirit was moved by dreams of the night before , and I vowed , in that bodily but invisible presence , that none , except one whose name I whispered , should ever kneel on that turf hand in hand with me . Borne out of my usual vein by the deed myself had done , I entered the ancient church , always left open for me , and , kneeling at the altar - rails , with many a Vaughan supine in prayer , pennons , helms , and trophies round me , stately dames in marble white , and old crusaders clutching still the cross - there I made my vow upon the knee - cupped stones , that if he claimed me not , the race should end with me . It was a presumptuous and unholy act , with all around me quelled by time , with ages laid aside in dust , with many a stouter heart and larger mind than mine , helpless even to superintend the wasting of his tenement , with all his bygone bliss and woe , stanchest love and deadliest hate , less eloquent now than the fly whom the spider has caught in his skull . Returning across the park , after a warm interview with "
125263	125517	125261	125261	Tulip	539	" who insisted mainly upon having his ears well scratched , I found my uncle in his snug wheel - chair , waiting near the side - door for me to help and accompany him forth . This was our best way to take him out , because of the steps at the front - door . He had not yet been in the open air since his terrible illness , but , judging by my own experience , I thought that he pined for the breeze , and , after long council , it was resolved to trust him forth this day . With all his heart he was longing to be out ; but , instead of expressing impatience , smiled gratefully at me . I now observed that he had a sweet and winning smile - a gift bestowed not rarely on faces of a sombre cast . In return for it I kissed him , and we sailed smoothly out . How he revelled , to be sure , in the first clear breath from the lips of heaven ! Stretching one poor arm forth - the other he could not move - he tried to spread himself like a flower to the sun . Then he drew long draughts of liquid freedom , and was for a time as one intoxicated . In the glorious crystal bath he seemed to float away from earth . Coming to himself at length , he looked at me , and said , "
125527	125536	125539	125539	John	422	" A year ago he would have said , "
125541	125636	125539	125539	John	422	" and no more . But illness is a great refiner . When John was out of sight he allowed free vent to the tears of joy and gratitude , whereof , in my opinion , he had no call to be ashamed . I kissed him many times . My warm impassioned nature always felt for and delighted in any touch like this . Then he placed his better hand on the cold and rigid one , lifting this with that , and poured forth silent thanks to the Giver of all things . "
125641	125647	125539	125539	John	422	" at length he said , "
125703	125734	125741	125741	me	0	" I will not repeat his words , because it would not become me ; but I am forced by all that has happened to show what his feelings were . "

You know I am quite helpless , and I ca n't live long , and you are all in all to me , and I am so proud of you , darling ! But it is not for myself I care . I can not tell , much less can you , what mischief may be done if you leave this house again . That low , crafty woman will be back again directly - she who made cowards of all the household , and acted the coward herself , who left me to die in my lonely bed , while she took all my keys . If her treachery succeeds , I shall rise from my grave . And I know she will poison me yet , if she gets the chance , and can make anything by it . "

Even if she could not have stopped them from opening that box of mine , at any rate she had no right to gossip about it , and enjoy it all , as she evidently had done . Furthermore , I knew well that she had always been on the tingle to learn the contents of that box , and many a time I had baffled her . Now she had triumphed thoroughly , and I should not have been female if I had calmly allowed it . But seeing her great distress through all of which she talked , with sobs for affirmations , I began to think what a pity it was ; then to wonder whether she deserved it all ; next , to believe that she had done no harm ; lastly , to feel that I had been a brute . Thereupon I rushed to coax and kiss her , wiped away her tears with my own lawn handkerchief - the feel of which consoled her , for the edge was lace - and begged her pardon fifty times in a thousand foolish words . Finally she was quite set up again by this : "

She could use the sitting - room for her own pleasure and pride , as much as ever she chose , so long as it always was ready for me ; and already visions were passing before her mind 's eye , of letting the parlour downstairs with the onion - room for its dormitory . To me the arrangement was very convenient , as affording a fixed and familiar resort in London , and a pivot of ready communication . Nor was it a small consolation to feel that I still retained a stronghold in the neighbourhood of dear friends . All this being comfortably settled , Giudice and I went forth to pay our visit in Lucas Street . The whole of that street we found so utterly changed in appearance by a vigorous onset of painters , grainers , and decorators , that it was not easy to know the house we were in quest of . Even the numbers on the doors , which had been illegible , or very nearly so , had now been re - arranged and painted over again upon the fashionable and very sensible mode of marking odd numerals on one side , and even ones on the other . Finding myself in a difficulty , and the houses all alike as the central peas of a pod , I trusted to Judy 's delicate nose , and rang the bell of the door at which he halted . Then he drew back , and trembled , and crouched upon the pavement , to wait for my return . As I heard the tinkle , my heart began to flutter : who could tell what new phase of my life might begin with that little pull ? After some delay , poor old Cora came , looking as weird and woebegone as ever - fierce would have been that look to any one but me . I knew that I held her by my magic gordit , like the slave of the lamp . After imploring in some mumbled words which I interpreted only by knowledge of her desire gracious leave to kiss that potent charm , she led me into the breakfast - parlour , where I found sweet Isola in a passionate flood of tears . At sight of me , her beautiful smile broke through them , and her quick deep sobs spent themselves in kisses . "

133309	133361	133299	133299	My	0	" I had never seen her look so lovely as now , her violet eyes brimming with liquid brightness , the velvet of her cheeks deepened to rich carmine , and the only thing that sweet face ever wanted , the expression of earnest feeling , now radiant through the whole . "
133385	133409	133377	133377	somebody	3257	" Here she pressed her little hand on that pure unfissured casket , where sorrow was as yet an undreamed - of robber . "

133567	133605	133562	133562	I	0	" This she said in such an artless way - as if Conrad and I were two dolls which she meant to put in one doll 's house - that instead of colouring , I actually laughed . "

133691	133707	133708	133710	A low bastard	3462	" And in my passion , I flung off her hand , and stood up . "
133729	133760	133724	133724	he	439	" She pronounced the last word almost with a scream , as an insult beyond forgiveness . What it meant I did not ask , I had heard enough already . "

133821	133839	133815	133815	he	439	" And she began to cry at the thought of the very thing she had wished for . "

133915	133987	133908	133908	he	5351	" In a few minutes we left the rude unpleasant house , and even Judy seemed relieved to get away from the door . By the time we reached Mrs. Shelfer 's , Idols was in capital spirits again , and pressed me for some account of the wonderful wealth , and the grand house she had heard of . No doubt this rumour had found its way through Ann Maples . "

134099	134104	134090	134090	you	3471	" said the judicious , "

134192	134206	134187	134187	you	0	" I was not attending much , but thinking of some one else . "
134253	134658	134241	134241	he	439	" I had jumped to that hope long ago , before we even left Lucas Street , and that had something to do with my walking so fast . No , he was not there , he had not been there to - day . It was my turn now to cry ; what might he not have done , after that fearful insult , and from his own father too ? The tears , which I confided to no one except the wooden - legged blackbird - for Giudice would have made such a fuss about them - were still upon my cheeks , when I heard the well - known step - not half so elastic as usual . I fled into my bedroom , and pushed the boxes about , to make a goodly noise , and to account for the colour in my face . Then out I came at the side - door , and ran downstairs perversely , though I knew that Conrad and Isola were in my sitting - room . But this first - rate manoeuvre only outwitted its author , for Isola ran down after me , and sent me upstairs alone . All my little nonsense vanished the moment I looked in Conrad 's face . His healthy brown complexion was faded to an opal white ; beneath his eyes such dark blue rims , that I thought he had spectacles on ; and on either cheek a round red spot was burning . So shocked I was , that when he took my hand , I turned my face away and smothered down a sob . I felt that I had no right to be so fresh and blooming . Nor was it only in health that the contrast between us lay . I was dressed with unusual care , having fidgeted all the morning , and with my utmost taste . Poor Conrad was in his working clothes , full of marble dust , tumbled , threadbare , and even in need of mending ; his hair swept anyhow , and his hands not over - lately washed . Yet , for all that , he was as clearly a gentleman , as I was a lady . Not so would he have been arrayed , I fancy , had he thought to see neat Clara . And yet , who knows ? "
134667	134673	134662	134662	you	3478	" he began to say , "

134710	134726	134703	134703	you	3478	" I knew not what to say , or how to keep my voice clear . "

134796	134809	134787	134791	No one in the world	3480	" I said very softly , and my voice thrilled through him . "
134819	134828	134812	134812	you	3478	" - am I though , thought I - "
134865	134897	134898	134898	Whoever	3483	" His throat was swelling with these bitter words , and he looked at his dusty clothes . Somewhat rude I thought him , but I knew not half his troubles . "
134922	135002	134916	134917	Your sister	3485	" And I turned away to the window . For a minute he said nothing ; but I could hear his heart beat . Stedfastly I looked at the cheesemonger 's shop . Oh for a flower , or something on the balcony ! Presently he came round the corner of the sofa . Without being rude , I could not help turning round . His face was much , much , brighter , and his eyes more kind . "

When I came to myself , both his arms were round me , and I was looking up at his poor sick face , my hair quite full of marble chips , and he was telling me with glad tears in his eyes , which he never took from mine , how he cared for nothing now , not for all the world , not for glory or fur shame , so long as I only loved him . "
135204	135208	135105	135105	I	0	" I whispered , "
135222	135286	135105	135105	I	0	" All the folly we went through I am not going to repeat , though I remember well every atom of it . Let the wise their wisdom keep , we are babes and sucklings . Neither of us had ever loved before , or ever meant to love again , except of course each other , and that should be for ever . "

135367	135471	135361	135361	I	0	" One moment I sprang from him ; the next I despised myself . But in spite of all my troubles , there still lurked in my heart the narrow pride of birth . Down to the earth it fell beneath the foot of true love , and I kissed away from his eyes the mingled reproach and sorrow , assuring him that at least he should have a legitimate wife . To make amends , I leaned upon him one moment , and put my hand on his shoulder , and let him play awhile with the dark shower of my hair . "

135649	135681	135643	135643	her	563	" With actual violence he thrust me from his arms , and stood staring at me , while I trembled from head to foot ; his face was one scarlet flame . "

I believe that my heart would have burst , if they had not cut my stays ; and how I wished it had . When I came back to my unlucky self , there was something shivery cold in the forehead wave of my hair . Was it Conrad 's finger ? I put up my hand to dash it away , and caught a fine fat leech . Dr. Franks was sitting by me , holding a basin and a sponge . "

I must tell you , dear , I was so anxious about something you can guess , that I stole up to the door soon after he came in ; and you were so intent upon the window , that you never even saw me put the door ajar ; and then I heard him tell you how very much he loved you , and I was so glad . And then I thought it was not quite fair of me , and I knew all I wanted , so I ran downstairs again . And the next thing I heard was your bedroom door bang and then Conny dashed out the house , and Judy came down to me looking very sorrowful . And I ran up to you , and here I found you shrieking so , and rolling , and clutching at the bedclothes , and I was so frightened I could not even move . And then Judy came and made such a dreadful howling , and Mrs. Shelfer ran straight off for the doctor , and I poured the water in the decanter over you , and I ca n't tell any more . "
137000	137013	136757	136757	I	0	" But surely , darling , you have been home since that ? "
137014	137115	137239	137239	My	0	" Oh yes ; when Dr. Franks came , and you were a little better , he would make me go home , because he did not want two patients , he said ; and his eldest daughter , such a nice girl , came with me ; and my papa did n't even know that I had been out of the house . He was still upstairs , brooding over his relics , and all the sixth form at the College had to go to dinner without their lectures ; but I do believe the stupid girls were glad . "
137116	137129	136762	136762	her	480	" And did you hear - no , it does n't matter . "
137130	137201	137239	137239	My	0	" No , I never heard what became of Conrad . No doubt he went back to his favourite chip , chipping . He has got a splendid thing he is full of now , and it prevents his sleeping ; something or other very horrible from Dante , and the leading figure is modelled after you . I have seen the drawings , and he has got you exactly . "
137202	137238	136762	136762	her	480	" How gratifying to be sure ! I will ask you no more questions . Pray let me know when I am for sale ; though I should call it a work of illegitimate art . "
137302	137323	137324	137325	Poor Isola	480	" Now I will delay no longer . Let me speak to Dr. Franks . I shall go this afternoon . "
137368	137413	137353	137353	She	480	" Do n't talk so , dear ; and you so very weak ! it would be sure to kill you . And what will Conny think ? You must not go , at any rate , till you have been to see him . "

How can he be your brother ? Darling Idols , I never shall forget you . Take this , my pet , and think of me sometimes , for you will never see me more . "

137586	137613	137523	137525	a plain keeper	3527	" No , not half so much . I like Pappy very well when he is good and kind , but that is not very often now "

137728	137780	137715	137715	She	5312	" Darling , I will write to you sometimes . You can come here for the letters . I will have no secrets any more from you ; but you must never attempt to write to me - only send your name on a bit of paper when my letters go . "
137781	137796	137824	137824	her	5312	" But why on earth may n't I write to you , Clara dear ? "
137797	137812	137715	137715	She	5312	" I ca n't tell you why . Only I can not bear it . "

The only vent she ever allowed this most expansive element was novel - reading , or a little quiet hero - worship . Her greatest happiness was to sit upon a lonely bank , and read a slashing curtel - axe and gramercy romance , with lots of high - born ladies in it , and lots of moonlight love . If history got hard thumps among them , and chronology , like an unwound clock , was right but twice in twenty - four , simple Annie smiled no less , so long as the summer sun flashed duly on pennon , helm , and gonfalon , and she could see bright cavalcades winding through the greenwood shade . In "
138387	138436	138437	138437	she	7244	" novels her soul took no delight . Not a shilling would she squeeze from her little beaded purse for all the quicksilver of Dickens , or the frosted gold of Thackeray . Yet she was not by any means what fast young ladies call a ' spooney ; "

As we passed along in the gloaming of the May , through bosomed lawn and bosky dell , with lilac plumes for cavaliers , and hawthorn sweeps for ladies ' trains , the soft gray eyes of Annie ceased at last to watch me , and her thoughts were in costume of Chevy Chase or Crecy . By reason of the message sent the day before , no one in the house expected me ; so we stole in quietly , lest my uncle should be alarmed , and I requested Gregory , tipsy Bob 's successor , to bring Jane to meet us , in my own little room . Annie being installed there , to her great delight , and allowed free boot of "

Very weak he seemed , and nervous , and more rejoiced at my return than even I had expected . To me also it was warm comfort in my cold pride - ailment to be with one of my own kin , whom none could well disparage . There was a dignity about him , an air of lofty birth , which my own darling father had been too genial to support . Soon I perceived from my uncle 's manner , that something had happened since my departure to add to his uneasiness . But he offered no explanation and I did not like to ask him . He in turn perceived the heavy dark despondency , which , in spite of all my efforts , would at times betray itself . Pride and indignation supported me , when I began to think , but then I could not always think , whereas I could always feel . Moreover , pride and indignation are , in almost every case , props that carry barbs . In a word , though I would scorn the love - lorn maiden 's part , it was sad for me to know that I could never love again . With a father 's tenderness , he feebly drew my head to his trembling breast , and asked me in a tearful whisper what had happened to me . But I was too proud to tell him . Oh that I had not been ! What misery might have been spared to many . But all the time my head lay there , I was on fire with shame and agony , thinking of the breast on which my hair had last been shed . "

139268	139332	139252	139252	you	300	" His voice shook so , while he asked this question , that I was quite certain something had alarmed him . The little room was the one I had occupied between the main corridor and his present bedroom . It was meant for an ante - room , not a sleeping chamber ; but I had brought my little iron bedstead thither . "

After giving Annie Franks her tea , which she was far too deep in tournament to drink , I paid a visit to Mrs. Fletcher 's room , and learned from her that nothing , so far as she knew , had happened to disturb my uncle : Mrs. Daldy had not been near the house , and there was a rumour afloat that she had been called to take part in a revival meeting near Swansea . So after introducing Judy , who was a dreadful dog for jam , and having him admired almost as much as he ought to be , I returned to Annie , and found her in high delight with everything and everybody , and most of all with her tapestry - writer . Leaving her at last under Tilly 's care , Judy and I were making off for our sleeping quarters , when truant Matilda followed me down the passage hastily . "

140605	142969	140593	140594	No ghost	3613	" And with that I went to bed , tired of such nonsense . An hour of deep sleep from pure weariness both of mind and body , and I awoke with every fibre full of nervous life . The moon was high in the south - east , and three narrow stripes of lozenged light fell upon the old oak floor . Although my uncle had left the gable where the windows faced the setting sun , he still kept to the western wing . The house , which was built in the reign of Henry the Eighth , covered the site and in some parts embodied the relics of a much more ancient structure . The plan was very simple , at least as regarded the upstair rooms . From east to west ran one long corridor , crossed at right angles , in the centre and near the ends , by three gable passages . Although there were so many servants , not half the rooms were occupied : all the best bedrooms had been empty many a year . No festivities had filled them since my father 's days . Gloom and terror still hung over the eastern part , where he had been so foully murdered . In most of the downstair windows along the front of the house , the rickety lattice of diamond panes had been replaced by clear plate - glass , but the old hall , and the corridor , and some of the gable windows still retained their gorgeous tints and heraldry . As the shadows of the mullions stole upon my counterpane , there began to creep across my mind uneasy inklings of the ghost . A less imaginative man than William Edwards , I who had often enjoyed his escort , knew well there could not be . As for Job Leyson I could not tell with what creative powers his mind might be endowed ; but - to judge from physiognomy - a light ring snaffle would hold them . Thinking , with less and less complacence , of this apparition story , and the red legend which lay beneath it , for the spectral lady was believed to be a certain Beatrice Vaughan , daughter of the Cavalier who perceived the moss - light , and heiress of the house 200 years ago - thinking of this , I say , with more and more of flutter , I sat up in the bed and listened . My uncle 's thick irregular breathing , the play of an ivy - leaf on the mullion , the half - hour struck by the turret - clock , were all the sounds I heard ; except that my heart , so listless and desponding , was re - asserting some right to throb for its own safety . With my hand upon it , I listened for another minute , resolving if I heard nothing more to make a great nest in the pillows - I always want three at least - and shut both ears to destiny . But there came , before the minute passed , a low , long , hollow sound , an echo of trembling expectation . In a moment I leaped from the bed ; though I had never heard it before , I knew it could only be the bloodhound 's cautious warning . I flung a long cloak round me , gathered close my hair , hurried velvet slippers on , locked my uncle in , and quietly opened the outer door . There stood Giudice in the moonlight , with his head towards the far east window , his ears laid back , his crest erect , and in his throat a gurgling sound , a growl suppressed by wonder . He never turned to look at me , nor even wagged his tail , but watched and waited grimly . I laid my hand upon him , and then glided down the corridor , avoiding the moonlight patches . Giudice followed , like my shadow , never a foot behind me , his tread as stealthy as a cat 's . Before I reached the oriel window where the broad light fell , something told me to draw aside and watch . I withdrew , and Giudice with me , into the dark entrance to my father 's room . Here we would see what came . Scarcely had I been there ten throbs of the heart , when between me and the central light , where the moonbeams fell askance , rose a tall gray figure . I am not quite a coward , for a woman at least , but every drop of blood within me at that sight stood still . Even Giudice trembled , and his growl was hushed , and every hair upon him bristled as he crouched into my cloak . Slowly the form was rising , like a corpse raised from a coffin by the loose end of the winding - sheet . I could not speak , I could not move , much less could I think . With a silent stately walk , or glide - for no feet could I see - the figure came towards the embrasure where we lurked . Ashy white the face was , large the eyes and hollow , all the hair fell down the back , the form was tall and graceful , one arm was lifted as in appeal , to heaven , and the shroud drooped from it , the other lay across the breast . The colour of the shroud was gray , pale , unearthly gray . For one moment as it passed , I kept my teeth from chattering . Giudice crawled one step before me , with his mind made up for death . Back the blood leaped to my heart , as the apparition glided slowly down the corridor without sigh or footfall . What to do I knew not ; my feet were now unrooted from the ground . Should I fly into my father 's death - room ? No ; I was afraid . To stay where I was seemed best , but how could I see it come back , as I knew it would ? Another such suspension of my life , and all , I felt , would be over . Suddenly , while still the figure was receding in the distance , I saw a great change in the bloodhound . He strode into the corridor , and began to follow . At the same time , the deep gurgle in his throat revived . In a moment , it flashed through me that he had smelt the ghost to be a thing of flesh and blood . It might be my father 's murderer . At any rate it had entered as he must have done . Close behind the dog I stole after the spectral figure . The supernatural horror fled ; all my life was in my veins . What became of me I cared not , I who was so wretched . Almost to the end , that gliding form preceded us , then turned down a flight of steps leading to the basement . Triple resolution gushed through me at this ; this was the spot where the ghost was known to turn , and glide back through the corridor . When it had descended about half - way down the staircase , where the steps were on the turn and narrow , standing at the head I distinctly heard a flop , as of a slipper - heel dropping from the foot , and then caught up again . What ghost was likely to want slippers ? And what mortal presence need I fear , with Judy at my side ? Keeping him behind me by a gentle touch , I hurried down the stairs . Luckily , I stopped before I turned the corner , for a gleam came up the passage ; the ghost had struck a lucifer . It was a dark and narrow passage , proof to any moon - light , and the spectre lost no time in lighting a small lamp , to find the study door ; I mean my uncle 's private study , where he kept his papers . The lamp was of peculiar shape , very small , and fitted with three reflectors , to throw the light in converging planes . Still remaining in deep shadow , I saw the person - ghost no longer - produce a key , open the study door and enter . Then an attempt was made to lock the door from the inside , but - as I knew by the sound - the false key would not work that way , and the door was only closed . Whispering into Judy 's ear , that if he dared to move - for his honest wrath at these burglarious doings could scarcely be controlled - I would make a ghost of him next day , I left him in the passage , and softly followed the intruder . First I looked through the key - hole ; the room was very dark and full of heavy furniture ; I could see nothing ; but must risk the chance . So I slipped in noiselessly and closed the door behind me . With the ghostly apparel thrown aside , and a mask laid on an ebony desk , stood intently occupied at the large bureau , which I had once so longed to search , my arch - enemy , Mrs. Daldy . I was not at all surprised , having felt long since that it could be no other . Sitting upon a stiff - backed velvet chair , in the shadow of an oaken bookcase - crouch I would not for her - I waited to see what she would do . Already the folding - doors of the large bureau were open ; their creaking had drowned the noise of my entry . Before her was exposed a multitude of drawers . All the visible doors she had probably explored on the previous nights , as well as the other repositories of various kinds which the room contained . Her search was narrowed now to one particular part of this bureau . The folding - doors were very large , and richly inlaid with arabesques and scroll - work of satin - wood and ebony : all the inside was fitted and adorned with ivory pillars , small alcoves containing baby mirrors , flights of chequered steps , and other quaint devices , besides the more business - like and useful sliding trays . With the lamp - light flashing on it , it looked like a palace for the Queen of Dolls - a place for puppet ceremony and pleasure . Every drawer was faced with marquetrie , every little door had panels of shagreen . In short , the whole thing would have been the pride of any shop in Wardour Street , when that street was itself . Having never seen it open till now , I was quite astonished , though I do n't know how often my father had promised to show it to me on my very next birthday , if I were good . Probably I was never good enough . Without any hesitation , Mrs. Daldy pressed a fan , or slide , of cedar - wood , in the right corner of the cabinet ; the slide sunk into a groove , and disclosed two deep , but narrow drawers ; these she pulled out from their boxes , and laid aside ; they were full of papers , which she no doubt had already examined . Then she placed the diminutive lamp on one of the doll steps , and produced from her pocket three or four little tools . Before commencing with these , she probed and pressed the partition between the sockets of those two drawers , in every imaginable way - a last attempt to find the countersign of some private nook , which had defied her the night before . At length , with a low cry of impatience , she seized a small , thin chisel , and a bottle of clear liquid : with the one she softened the buhl veneer upon the partition 's face , and with the other she removed it . Then , after a little unscrewing , she carefully prized away the stop of cedar - wood , while I admired her workman - like proceedings so far as they were visible to me , and the graceful action of the arms she was so proud of . Her shoulder came rather in my way , but I got a glimpse of the narrow , vertical opening , where the cedar - stop had been . She drew a long breath of delight and pride , then thrust a wire - crook into this opening , and hooked forth two thin and closely - fastened packets . Eagerly she looked at them ; they were what she wanted . No doubt she knew their contents ; her object was to get hold of them . Having placed them carefully in her bosom , she prepared for a little more joiner 's work , to restore what she had dismantled . Her dexterity was so pleasing , that I let her proceed for a while . She soon refixed the cedar - stop , tapping it in the most knowing way with the handle of the screw - driver , then she screwed it tightly , and spread the wood with some liquid cement to carry the veneer . She had mislaid the narrow strip of tortoise - shell and brass , and was looking for it on the chequered steps , when I called aloud : "
142992	143122	142987	142987	you	3615	" Never was amazement written more strongly on any human face . If the ghost had frightened me , I now had my full revenge . She dropped the bottle of cement , and it rolled on the cabinet steps ; she turned , with her face as white as the mask , and glared round the room , for I was still concealed in the recess . I thought she would have blown out the lamp , but she had not presence of mind enough : otherwise among all that furniture it would not have been easy to catch her ; and she knew nothing of my sentinel at the door . After some quiet enjoyment of her terror , I came forth , and met her fairly . "
143139	143140	143134	143134	you	300	" "
143185	143267	143177	143177	you	300	" Low exultation I confess : but the highest blood in the land , if it were blood , could scarcely have forborne it : for how I abhorred that hypocrite ! For a time she knew not what to do or say , but glared at me without much Christian feeling . Then she tried to carry it off in a grandly superior style . She drew herself up , and looked as if I were not worth reasoning with . "
143285	143286	143269	143269	you	300	" "
143315	143316	143288	143288	you	300	" "
143347	143371	143340	143340	yours	300	" She grasped her chisel , and stood in a menacing attitude . I answered her very quietly , and without approaching nearer . "
143392	143453	143390	143390	Giudice	490	" And I gave a peculiar whistle thoroughly known to my dog . He leaped against the door , forced the worn catch from the guard , and stood at my side , with his great eyes flashing and his fangs laid bare . Mrs. Daldy jumped to the other side of the table , and seized a heavy chair . "
143503	143504	143478	143478	God	309	" "
143522	143967	143478	143478	God	309	" and I looked at Giudice and began to raise my hand . His eyes were on it , and he gathered himself for the spring like a cannon recoiling . In the height of her terror , she tore her dress open and flung me the packets across the end of the table . I examined and fixed them to Judy 's collar . Then we both advanced , and penned her up in a corner . It was so delightful to see her for once in her native meanness , despoiled of her ca nt and phylactery , like a Pharisee under an oil - press . She fell on her knees and implored me , in plain earnest English for once , to let her go . She appealed to my self - interest , and offered me partnership in her schemes ; whereby alone I could regain the birthright of which I had been so heinously robbed . I only asked if she could reveal the mystery of my father 's death . She could not tell me anything , or she would have jumped at the chance . At last I promised to let her go , if she would show me the secret entrance under the oriel window . It was not for her own sake I released her , but to avoid the scandal and painful excitement which her trial must have created . When she departed , now thoroughly crestfallen , I followed her out of the house by the secret passage , wherein she had stored a few of her stage - properties . Giudice , whom , for fear of treachery , I kept at my side all the time , showed his great teeth in the moonlight , and almost challenged my right to let her go . After taking the packets from him , I gave him a sheepskin mat under the window there , and left him on guard ; although there was little chance of another attempt being made , while the papers were in my keeping . Her mask and spectral drapery remained with me , as trophies of this my ghostly adventure . CHAPTER VII . Next day when I showed my uncle the two sealed packets which I had rescued , and told him all that had happened , at first he was overcome with terror and amazement . His illness seemed to have banished all his satirical humour , and that disdainful apathy which is the negative form of philosophy . He took the parcels with a trembling hand , and began to examine the seals . "
143971	143977	143478	143478	God	309	" he said at last , "
144162	144163	144159	144159	I	0	" "
144171	144172	144159	144159	I	0	" "
144196	144222	144223	144223	My	0	" I could not answer , for a minute . Then I took his hand and kissed it , as he turned his face away . "
144305	144520	144521	144521	I	0	" I begged him in vain to defer it : there was a weight upon his mind , he said , which he must unload . So in the early afternoon , I wheeled him gently to the sheltered nook . There , with the breezes way - lost among new streets of verdure , tall laburnum dangling chains of gold around us , and Giudice stretching out his paws in sunny yawns of glory , I listened to my uncle 's tale , and was too young to understand the sigh which introduced it . How few may tell the story of their lives without remembering how they played with life ! Alas the die thrown once for all , but left to roll unwatched , and lie uncounted ! Though I can not tell the story in his impressive way , I will try to repeat it , so far as my memory serves , in his words , and with his feelings . Solemnly and sadly fell the history from his lips , for his mind from first to last was burdened with the knowledge that the end was nigh at hand , that nothing now remained , except to wait with resignation the impending blow . STORY OF EDGAR VAUGHAN . "
144673	145045	144623	144623	My	0	" The estates , I need not tell you , were shamefully mismanaged , during your father 's long minority . An agent was appointed under the Court of Chancery , and an indolent rogue he was . Meanwhile your father and myself went through the usual course of education , no difference being made in that respect between us . Although we were only half - brothers , we were strongly attached to each other , especially after a thorough drubbing which your good papa found it his duty to administer to me at Eton . It did me a world of good ; before that , I had rather despised him for the gentleness of his nature . At Oxford , after your father had left , I kept aloof both from the great convivial and from the thinly peopled reading set , and lived very much by myself . Soon as the humorous doings , whose humour culminates in the title ' lectures , ' soon as these were over , I was away from the freckled stones , punting lazily on the Cherwell , with French and Italian novels ; or lounging among the gipseys on the steppes of Cowley . Hall I never frequented , but dined at some distant tavern , and spent the evening , and often the night till Tom - curfew , in riding through the lonely lanes towards Otmoor , Aston Common , or Stanlake . It was strange that I never fell in love , for I had plenty of small adventures , and fell in with several pretty girls , but never one I cared for . Gazing on the wreck I am , it is no conceit to say that in those times I was considered remarkably good - looking . Of course I was not popular ; that I never cared for ; but nobody had reason to dislike me . I affected no peculiarity , gave myself no airs , behaved politely to all who took the trouble to address me ; and the world , which I neither defied nor courted , followed its custom in such cases , and let me have my way . "
145155	145240	145248	145248	I	0	" You have heard that I was extravagant . As regards my early career , the charge is quite untrue . Money , I confess , was never much in my thoughts , nor did I ever attempt to buy things below their value ; but my wants were so few , and my mode of life so ungenial , that I never exceeded the moderate sum allotted to me as a younger son . Afterwards this was otherwise , and for excellent reasons . "
145330	145608	145615	145615	he	3652	" Your parents were married , my darling Clara , at the end of December , 1826 , six years before your birth . Upon that occasion , your dear father , the only man in the world for whom I cared a fig , made me a very handsome present . In fact he gave me a thousand pounds . He would have given me a much larger sum , for he was a most liberal man , but the estates had suffered from long mismanagement , and were seriously encumbered . I do not hesitate to say that the gross income of this property is now double what it was when your father succeeded to it , and the net income more than quadruple . During the four years which elapsed between that event and his marriage , he had devoted all he could spare to the clearance of encumbrances and therefore , as I said , the present he made me was a most generous one . More than this , he invited and pressed me to come and live on the estate , and offered to set me up in a farm which I might hold from him on most advantageous terms . Upon my refusal , he even begged me to accept , at a most liberal salary , the stewardship of the property , and the superintendence of great improvements , which he meant to effect . I remember , as if it were yesterday , the very words he used . He took my hand in his , and with that genial racy smile , which very few could resist , "
145647	145670	145637	145637	you	303	" At the sweet recollection of his Eton drubbing , as he called it , my poor uncle 's eyes grew moist . "
146124	146358	146116	146116	I	0	" ' And freedom made a deal too free with me , ' which expresses briefly the moral of my life . However , at the time I speak of , nursing perhaps a younger son 's bias against the social laws , and fresh from the true simplicity and unaffected warmth of your father 's character and the gentle sweetness of your mother 's , I could not sit on the spikes of fashion 's hackney coach , as becomes a poor Briton , till the driver whips behind . Finding of course that no one cared whether I sat there or not , and that all I got at the side of the road was pea - shots from cads in the dickey , I did what thousands have done before me , and will probably do again , I voted my fellow - Britons a parcel of drivelling slaves , and longed to be out of the gang . Perhaps I should never have made my escape , for like most of my class , I spent all my energy in small eccentricity , if it had not been for what we idlers entitle the force of circumstances . At a time when my life was flowing on calmly enough though babbling against its banks , it came suddenly on an event which drove it into another and rougher channel . "
146505	146670	146682	146682	I	0	" After rowing steadily for several hours , I found myself a long way past my customary Cape Turn - again . With a strong ebb tide as well as a land - fresh in the river , I had got beyond Barking Reach , and as far as the Dagenham marshes . Here some muddy creeks , pills , and sluggish channels wind and welter among the ooze - lands on the north side of the Thames . All around them stretches and fades away a dreary flat monotonous waste ; no dot of a house , no jot of a tree , to vary the dead expanse ; except that by the river - side one or two low cabooses , more like hoys than houses , are grounded among the slime . This , so far as my memory serves , was the state of these Essex marshes in the year 1829 : how it is now I can not say . "
146996	147567	147570	147570	I	0	" Suddenly a clear loud cry broke my vacant musings . It startled me so that I caught a crab , ceased rowing , and gazed around . At first I could not tell whence it came , till my boat , with the way she had on her , shot round a low spit of the Essex shore , which from the curve of the river I was nearing rapidly . Louder and louder the cry was twice repeated , and I heard in the still spring evening the oaths of men and the scuffling of feet . Within fifty yards of me was an ill - looking house , made of battens , and raised on piles above high water mark . A tattered sign hung on a pole , and a causeway led to the steps . While I was hesitating , two figures crossed a lattice window , as if in violent struggle , and a heavy crash resounded . Three strong strokes of my oars , and the keel grated on the causeway . Out I leaped with the boat - hook , threw the painter over a post , and rushed up the slimy jetty , and the narrow wooden steps . The door was fastened , I pushed it with all my force , but in vain . One faint scream reached my ears , as of some one at length overpowered . Swinging the boat - hook with both hands , I struck the old door with the butt , and broke it open . In the lower room there was no one , but a moaning and trampling sounded over head . Upstairs I ran , and into the room where the villany was doing . A poor girl lay on the floor at the last gasp of exhaustion . Two ruffians with a rope were bending over her . Down went one , at a blow of my boat - hook , flat beside his victim : the other leaped at my throat . I saw and soon felt that he was a powerful man , but in those days I was no cripple . We were most evenly matched . I wrenched his hand from my throat , but twice he got me under him , twice I writhed from his grasp like a python from a tiger 's jaw . Clutched and locked in each other 's arms , in vain we tugged to get room for a blow . Throttle , and gripe , and roll - which should be first insensible ? An accident gave me the mastery . For a moment we lay face to face , glaring at each other , drawing the strangled breath , loosing the deadly grip , panting , throbbing , and watching . My boat - hook lay on the floor , my enemy spied and made a sudden dash at it . Instead of withholding , I jobbed him towards it with all my might , and as he raised it , the point entered one of his eyes . With a yell of pain and fury , he sank beneath me insensible . Shaking and quaking all over after the desperate struggle , I bound him and his mate , hand and foot , with the twisted tarry junk , which they had meant for the maiden . "
147706	147960	147699	147700	Both ladies	3693	" For the rest a few words will suffice . The poor ladies revived at last , after chafing of hands and sprinkling , and told me where to find the woman of the house , who had been locked up in another room by her husband and brother . There was no one else on the premises . How came the ladies there , what was their destination , and why were they so outraged ? They were on their return to London from the Continent , being called home by tidings of death , and had sailed from Antwerp two days and a - half before , in the steamer which I had seen lying to . Steamers were then heavy lumbering things , and all that time Mrs. Green and her daughter had been knocking about on a pecky sea . No wonder that the poor mother had cried out feebly , to be landed anywhere , anywhere in the world , where things would leave off going round . And before they came to that tedious halt in the river , fair Adelaide , who had enjoyed her meals throughout , renewed and completed her poor mamma 's excavation , by inquiring calmly with her mouth full of pickled pork , where the peas - pudding was . Now too Miss Adelaide soon recovered from her fearful battle for honour and life . She was what is called now - a - days a girl of ' splendid organisation . "
148057	148216	148414	148414	him	3702	" Having restored their watches , and scattered trinkets , and led the poor things from the scene of the combat , I was quite at a loss for means to convey them home . Barking was a long way off , and the marshy track unknown to me , and not likely to be found in the dark . Moreover , there must be some hazard in leaving them still in that villanous den , no matter how their cowardly foes might be bound . At last , and with great difficulty , I embarked the two ladies in my shallop , and wrapped them warmly from the night air ; then after relashing my prisoners , and locking them up in separate rooms , and the woman downstairs , I pulled away stoutly for Woolwich . Here I obtained a carriage , and started my convoy for London , and then returned with two policemen to the "
148221	148261	148414	148414	him	3702	" as the low caboose was called . But both our birds were flown , as I was inclined to expect . Most likely the woman had contrived to get out , and release them . At any rate the "
148265	148361	148414	148414	him	3702	" had no crew , and the deserters had set it on fire . The flames , as we rowed away , after vainly searching the marshes , cast a lurid glow on the mud - banks , and on the slackening tide ; a true type it was of what soon befell me - the burning of my caboose . The two men were caught long afterwards by the Thames Police , and transported for life on a conviction for river piracy . At least , I was told that they were the men . "
148362	148381	148414	148414	him	3702	" And of course , dear uncle , you fell deeply in love with the beautiful Adelaide Green . "
148382	148406	148414	148414	him	3702	" Of course , my dear , a young lady would conclude so . But at present I must not talk any more . "
148416	148456	148457	148457	He	3702	" And what I have next to relate is matter of deeper feeling . By Jove , to think how I battled with that strong man ! And now your little fist , Clara , would floor me altogether . "
148533	149029	148528	148531	STORY OF EDGAR VAUGHAN	586	" On the following day , when I called at the house in Bloomsbury - then a fashionable neighbourhood - to which I had been directed , I was met at the threshold , with power and warmth , by Peter Green himself , an old acquaintance of mine , who proved to be Adelaide 's brother . My nature had been too reserved for me to be friendly with him at College , but I had liked him much better than any one else , because he was so decided and straight - forward . The meeting rather surprised me , for Green is not a rare name , and so it had never occurred to me to ask the weary Adelaide whether she knew one Peter Green , a first - class man of Christchurch . Peter , who was a most hearty fellow , and full , like his sister , of animal life , overpowered me with the weight of his gratitude , which I did not at all desire or deserve . As , in spite of your rash conclusion , my romantic Clara , I did not fall in love with Adelaide , who besides her pithsome health and vigour was in many respects astray from my fair ideal , and more than all , was engaged long ago to the giver of the sapphire ring , I need not enlarge upon my friendship with Peter Green , whom I now began to like in real earnest . Young as he was , his father 's recent death had placed him at the head of a leading mercantile house , Green , Vowler , and Green , of Little Distaff Lane . And young as he was - not more than seven - and - twenty - his manners were formed , and his character and opinions fixed , as if he had seen all the ways , and taken stock of the sentiments of all the civilised world . Present to him any complexity , any conflict of probabilities , any maze whose ins and outs were abroad half over the universe , and if the question were practical , he would see what to do in a moment ; if it were theoretical , he would quietly move it aside . I have known many learned judges sum up a case most lucidly , blow away all the verbiage , sweep aside all the false issues , balance the contradictions , illuminate all the obscurities , and finally lift from its matrix , and lay in the colourless sunlight the virgin truth , without either dross or polish . All this Peter Green seemed to have done in a moment , without any effort , without any reasoning process ; not jumping at his conclusion , but making it fly to him .

With all these business qualities , my friend was as merry and unpretentious a man as ever made a bad joke , or laughed at another fellow 's ; liberal also , warm - hearted , and not sarcastic . In a word , he was a genuine specimen of the noble English merchant , who has done more to raise this country in the esteem of the world than would a thousand Nelsons or Wellingtons . Now this man discerned at a glance the wretched defects of my nature and position . An active mind like his could never believe in the possibility of being happy without occupation . And by occupation he meant , not the chasing of butterflies , or maundering after foxes , but real honest Anglo - Saxon work ; work that strings the muscles , or knits the hemispheres of the brain . And work he would himself , ay , and with all his energies . Not the man was he to tap the table with his pipe , and cry out , "
149293	149836	149843	149843	Vaughan	300	" but he was the man to throw off his coat , and pitch into the matter before him without many words , though with plenty of thought . Now , this man , feeling deeply indebted to me , and beginning to like me as my apathy and reserve went to pieces before his energy , this man , I say , cast about for some method of making me useful and happy . Wonderfully swift as he was in pouncing upon the right thing , I believe it took him at least five minutes to find out the proper course for an impracticable fellow like me . And when he had found this out , it took even him a week to draw the snail out of his hole . Years of agreeable indolence , and calm objective indifference , seldom ruffled except at fashionable snobbery , had made of me not a Sybarite , or a supercilious censor , much less a waiter on fortune , but a contemplative islander , a Haytian who had been once to Spain , and would henceforth be satisfied with the view of her caravels . But my Adelantado was a man of gold and iron . Green , Vowler , and Green were largely concerned in the oil and dried fruit business . They had ransacked the olive districts of continental Europe , and found the price going up and the quality going down , so they wanted now to open another oil vein . Peter Green observing my love of uncultured freedom , the only subject on which I ever grew warm and rapturous , espied the way to relieve me of some nonsense , give my slow life a fillip , and perhaps - oh climax - open a lucrative connexion . He knew , for he seemed to know everything done or undone by commerce , that there was a glorious island rich in jewels and marble and every dower of nature , and above all teeming with olives , lemons , and grapes , and citrons ; and that this gifted island still remained a stranger , through French and Genoese ignorance , to our London trade . This was the island libelled by Seneca , idolised by its natives , drenched with more blood than all the plains of Emathia , yet mother of heroes and conquerors of the world - if that be any credit - in a single word , Corsica . Once or twice indeed our countrymen have attempted to shake hands with this noble race , so ruined by narrow tradition ; and in the end we shall doubtless succeed , as we always do ; but the grain of the Corsican is almost as stubborn as our own . In fact the staple is much the same , the fabric is very different . Bold they are , and manly , simple , generous , and most hospitable , lovers too of their country beyond all other nations ; but - oh fatal ignorance - industry to them is drudgery ; and labour is an outrage . Worse than all is the fiend of the island , the cursed Blood - revenge . "

But before I went , your poor father , Clara , protested most strongly against the scheme , and even came to London in the vain hope of dissuading me . He had some deep presentiment that it would end darkly , and so indeed it did . "
150812	150818	150810	150810	Ned	586	" said he once more , "
150959	151715	150953	150953	I	0	" Ah , me ! If I had only listened to him . And yet , I do n't know . After a pleasant voyage we reached the magnificent island , about the middle of May. My intention was to skirt round it from the southern extremity , taking the western side first , and touching at every anchorage , whence I would make incursions , and return to my little cutter , as the most convenient head - quarters . Of course I should have to rough it ; but what young man would think twice of that , with an adventurous life before him ? I will not weary you , my dear child , with a long description of Corsica . It is a land which combines all the softness and the majesty , all the wealth and barrenness , all the smile and menace of all the world beside . I could talk of it by the hour ; but you want to know what I did , and was done to , more than what I saw . From the awful rock of Bonifazio , the streets where men should have no elbows , and the tower of Torrione , along the fantastic coast which looks as if time were a giant rabbit , we traced the blue and spur - vexed sea , now edged with white , and now with gray , and now with glowing red , until we reached that paradise of heaven , the garden of Balagna . CHAPTER IX . STORY OF EDGAR VAUGHAN . Let me hold myself . Weak as I am and crippled by premature old age , not the shortness of my breath , not the numbness of my heart , not even the palsy of my frame , can quench or check the fire rekindled by the mere name of that heavenly valley . To live there only half a minute is worth a day of English life . Life - it is a space to measure , not by pendulum or clock - hand , not by our own strides to and fro the ordnance scale of the million , not even by the rolling sun , and nature 's hail and farewell ; but by the well - spring of ourselves , the fount of thought and feeling . Every single breath I draw of this living air - air the bride of earth our sire , wedded to him by God Creator , air whose mother - milk we fight for in clusters baulking one another - every breath I draw dances with a buoyant virtue , sucked , in any other land , but from mountain nipples . Bright air of a rosy blue , where northern eyes are dazed with beauty , where every flower cuts stars of light , and every cloud is sunshine 's step ; can even lovers parted thus believe themselves divided ? Every rock has its myrtle favour , every tree its clematis wreath ; under the cistus and oleander hides the pink to lace its bodice , watched by the pansy 's sprightly eye . Lavishly , as children 's bubbles , hover overhead oranges , and citrons , lemons , almonds , figs , varied by the blushing peach and the purpling grape . Far behind , and leaning forth the swarthy bosom of the mountain , whose white head leans on the heaven , are ranks on ranks of glaucous olive , giants of a green old age dashed with silver gray . And oh , the fragrance under foot , the tribute of the ground , which Corsica 's great son - as we men measure greatness - pined for in the barren isle , where the iron of his selfishness entered his own soul . These are said to be the largest olive - trees in the world , and of the very best varieties . Heaps upon heaps the rich fruit lies at the foot of the glorious tree ; nature is too bountiful for man to heed her gifts . For this district of Balagna , and that of Nebbio further north , my attention had been especially bespoken by my shrewd and sagacious friend . Therefore and by reason of the charms around me , here I resolved to pass the summer ; so my vessel was laid up at Calvi , and being quartered in Belgodere at a little Inn - "
151717	151864	150953	150953	I	0	" it should be called , but I hate interlarding - I addressed myself right heartily to business and to pleasure . First I had to study the grand Palladian gift . Unless old Seneca was , as the Corsicans say , a great liar , he can not have been the author of that epigram which declares this land a stranger to the peaceful boon . It is impossible to believe that a country so adapted to that tree , so often colonized by cultured races , can have been so long ungifted with its staff of life . The island itself in that same epigram is utterly mis - described . As regards the inhabitants , the first line of the well - known couplet is verified by ages ; to the second it does not plead guilty now , and probably never did . "
151891	152102	151884	151885	The fourth	6456	" The Corsicans , on the contrary , have always been famous for candour , whose very soul is truth , and for superstition , the wen or hump of religion . For my own part , loving not that unprincipled fellow hard labour , towards whom these noble islanders entertain a like antipathy , and loving much any freedom not hostile to my own , I got on with the natives admirably , for a certain time . Time had reconciled me to their custom of carrying , instead of cane or umbrella , long double - barrelled guns , whose muzzle they afford the stranger full opportunity of inspecting . First - rate marksmen are they , but they sling their guns at hap - hazard on their backs , and cheek to jowl we come upon the cold metal at the corner of the narrow streets . Tall and powerful men they are , especially the mountaineers ; with all the Spaniard 's dignity and the Italian 's native grace . The women are lithe , erect , and beautifully formed , with a swan - like carriage , and a free and courteous bearing , such as very few of our high - born damsels own . "
152105	152677	152682	152682	his	3762	" of Virgil . The olive - growers frankly gave me all their little information about that tree whose typical virtues they have never cared to learn . The variety chiefly grown , or rather which chiefly grows itself , is one they call the Genoese . The owners afford them very little culture , and many are too idle even to collect the fruit . There are said to be ten million olive - trees in the island ; at least they were reckoned up to that number by order of the Government ; then the enumerators grew tired , and left off counting . Whatever number there is might easily be tripled , if any one had the energy to graft the oleasters , with which the hills are covered . There is also the Saracen olive , and the Sabine , the latter perhaps the Regia of Columella , Raggiaria of Casalpinus , and Radius of Virgil . However , though not unlike my sample fruit , it was not quite identical , and as my employers wanted a very special sort for very special qualities , I was as far from my object as ever . One magnificent summer evening , as I rode along the mountain side near the village of Speloncato , suddenly the track turned sharply into a wooded dingle . Steeped in the dream of nature 's beauty , I was thinking of nothing at all , as becomes a true Corsican , when I received a sharpish knock in the eye . Something fell and lodged in my capacious beard . Smarting from the pain . I caught it , and not being able to see clearly , took it at first for a spent and dropping bullet . But when my eyes had ceased to water , I found in my hand a half - grown olive of the very kind I had so long been seeking . I drew forth some of my London specimens which had been chemically treated to prevent their shrivelling , and compared it narrowly . Yes , there could be no doubt ; the same pyriform curve , the same bulge near the peduncle , the same violet lines in the skin , and when cut open , the same granulation and nucleus . I was truly delighted , at length I should be of some real service ; at least if there were many trees here of this most rare variety . By riding up the dingle , I soon ascertained that it was planted with trees of this sort only , gray old trees of a different habit from any other olive . Afterwards I found that it requires a different soil , and a different aspect . Full speed I galloped back to the hamlet of Speloncato , and inquired for the owner of this olive Eldorado . Signor Dezio Della Croce , owner of all this lovely slope , and of large estates extending as far as the road to Corte ; in fact the chief proprietor of the neighbourhood . He was , said the peasant with some pride , a true descendant of the great race of Cinarca , foremost in the island annals for a thousand years , and of whom was the famous Giudice Della Rocca , Count and Judge of Corsica , six hundred years ago . "
152710	154824	152704	152704	he	601	" Let the Cinarchesi blood go for its full value ; but it was worth something to the Della Croce to be descended also from the Tuscan Malaspina ; for the lands of those great Marquises were now in the possession of the Signor Dezio . And the Signor had such a daughter , a young maiden . Ah , Madonna ! The loveliest girl in Corsica . And the vine - dresser crossed himself . As I listened to all this information , I began to look through my unused credentials , which I always carried . It struck me that this name of Della Croce was quite familiar to me , though I knew not how , until a letter in the sprawling hand of young Laurence Daldy fell out from among Peter 's crabbed characters . Laurence Daldy , my mother 's younger son , was now in full career , as a pigeon and a Guardsman , spending at full gallop his dead father 's money . These Daldys were of Italian origin , the true name being D'Aldis , which after some years of English life they had naturalised into Daldy . And now I recollected that when we Vaughan boys scorned them as ignoble sons of commerce , they used to brag about their kinship to the ancient Della Croce . Riding up the forest hill , on whose western bluff stands boldly the gray old tower of the Malaspinas , I began of course to make forecasts about the character of my host . My host I knew he needs must be , for Corsica is of all the world the most hospitable spot . Although by this time well acquainted with the simple island habits , I could not but expect to find a man of stateliness and surroundings , of stiffness and some arrogance . Now the sun was setting , and the western fire from off the sea glanced in spears of reddening gold into the solemn timeworn keep . All things looked majestic , but a deal too lonely . Where was I to apply , how was I to get in ? The narrow doorway overhung with the wreck of some portcullis , was blocked instead with a sort of mantlet like the Roman Vinea ; the loopholes on the ground - tier were boarded almost to the top , the high windows , such as they were , had their rough shutters closed . Everything betokened a state of siege and fear . Two or three magnificent chesnuts , which must have commanded the front of the tower , had been cut down and added to the defences of the approach . Over these I managed at last to leap my horse , who was by no means a perfect hunter ; and there I halted at a loss how to proceed . I had been long enough in Corsica to know , even without a certain ominous gleam from a loophole , and the view in transverse section of a large double - barrelled gun , that the owner of this old mansion was now in the pleasant state of Vendetta . Expecting every moment to be shot , and nothing said about it , I waved my letter , as a white flag , furiously above my head . Presently that frightful muzzle was withdrawn , and the slide pushed back , to reconnoitre me at leisure . I tried , for the first time in my life , to look like a real Briton ; my Corsican ambition was already on the wane . So I sat my horse , and waited ; and what came was worth a thousand years of waiting . Round the bastion of the tower , under the rich magnolia bloom , towards me glided through the rosy shadow the loveliest being that ever moved outside the gates of heaven . She seemed not to walk but waft along , like the pearly Nautilus . A pink mandile of lightest gauze lit the sable of her clustering hair , and wreathing round her graceful head deepened the tinge of the nestling cheeks . The lithe faldetta of white cashmere , thrown hastily over the shoulders , half concealed the flowing curves of the slender supple form , half betrayed them as it followed every facile motion . But when she smiled - oh , Clara , I would have leaped from her father 's tower , or into the black caves of the Restonica , for one smile of hers . The dark - fringed lustre of her eyes seemed to dance with golden joy , trusting , hoping , loving all things , pleasure pleased at pleasing . And the gleesome arch of her laughing lips , that never shaped evil word ! Oh , my Lily , my own Lily , I shall see you soon again . My dear Clara , I ought to know better . I am ashamed of myself . And after so many years ! But at the first glance of Fiordalisa , my fate was fixed for this life and the other . I never had loved before . I never had cared to look at a girl ; in fact I despised them all . Now I paid for that contemptuous folly . Loving at one glance , loving once , for all , for ever , my heart stood still like the focus of a hurricane ; my speech and every power but that of vision failed me . I dared not try to leave the saddle , such a trembling took me . It was a visitation unknown in our foggy plains , scoffed at by our prosy race , but known full well in Southern climes , as the sunstroke of love . My own darling - I can call her nothing less - my own delicious darling was quite startled at me . Whether she had a like visitation in a milder form , is more than I can say ; but I hope with all my heart she had ; for then , as the Southern tale recites , God placed her hand in mine . How I got my horse tied up , how I followed her through the side entrance , and returned her father 's greeting , I have not the least idea ; all I know is that she smiled , and I wanted nothing more . But I could not bear to see her in the true Homeric fashion still maintained in Corsica , waiting on us like a common servant , with her beautiful arched feet glancing under the brown pelone , and her tapering white arms laid demurely on her bosom ; then at her father 's signal how she flew for the purple grapes or the fragrant broccio ! But do what she would , it seemed to become her more than all she had done before . As that form of love and elegance flitted through the simple room , and those lustrous heavenly eyes beamed with hospitable warmth , Signor Dezio Della Croce , careworn man with beard of snow , seemed at times no little proud of his sweet and only child , but was too proud to show his pride . As for me , he must have thought that I spoke very poor Italian . END OF VOL . II . BOOK IV . continued . CHAPTER X. STORY OF EDGAR VAUGHAN . Child Clara , for your own dear sake , as well as mine and my sweet love 's , I will not dwell on that tempestuous time . If you can not comprehend it without words , no words will enable you . If you can , and I fear you do , no more words are wanted ; and , as an old man weary of the world , I know not whether to envy or to pity you . Hither and thither I was flung , to the zenith star of ecstasy or the nadir gulf of agony , according as my idol pet chose to smile or frown . Though she was no silly child , but a girl of mind and feeling , she had a store , I must confess , of clouds as well as dazzling sunlight in the empyrean of her eyes . Her nature , like my love , was full of Southern passion . It is like the air they breathe , the beauty they behold . One minute of such love compresses in a thunder flood all the slow emotions stealing through the drought - scrimped channel , where we dredge for gold deposits , through ten years of Saxon courtship . Instead of Lily - bloom , she should have been called the Passion - flower . My life , my soul - how weak our English words are - she loved me from the first , I can take my oath she did , although her glory was too great for her to own it yet , though now and then her marvellous eyes proved traitors . Sometimes when she was racking me most , feigning even , with those eyes cast down , her pellucid fingers point to point , and her little foot tapping the orchid bloom , feigning , I say , in cold blood , to reckon her noble lovers - long names all and horribly hateful to me - suddenly , while I trembled , and scowled like a true - born Briton , suddenly up would leap the silky drooping lashes , and a spring of soft electric light would flutter through them to the very core of my heart . As for me , I abandoned myself . I made no pretence of waiting a moment . I flung my heart wide open to her , and if she would not come in , desert it should be for ever . She did come . That life - blood of my soul came in , and would and could live nowhere else for ever . It was done like this . One August evening , when the sun was sinking , and the air was full of warmth and wooing sounds , the cicale waking from his early nap , the muffro leaping for the first dew - drop , the love - birds whispering in the tamarind leaves , Fiordalisa sat with me , under a giant cork - tree on the western slope . The tower was still in Vendetta siege , and the grave and reverend Signor knew better than to come out , when the Sbirri were gone to the town . Lily - bloom was sitting by me in a mass of flowers ; her light mandile was laid by , that her glorious hair might catch the first waft of the evening breeze . All down her snow - white shoulders fell the labyrinth of tresses , twined by me with red Tacsonia , and two pale carnations . Her form was pillowed in rich fern , that feathered round her waist ; of all the fronds and plumes and stems , not one so taper , light , and rich as that . The bloom upon her cheeks was deepened by my playing with her hair , and her soft large eyes were beaming with delicious wonder . We knew , as well as He who made us , that we loved one another . None who did not love for ever could interchange such looks . Suddenly , and without a word , in an ecstasy of admiration , I passed my left arm round her little waist , drew her close to me - she was very near before - and looking full into her wondrous eyes , found no protest but a thrill of light ; then tried her lips and met her whole heart there . Darling , how she kissed me ! No English girl can do it . And then the terror of her maiden thoughts . The recollection of her high - born pride , and higher because God - born innocence . How she wept , and blushed , and trembled ; trembled , blushed , and wept again ; and then vouchsafed one more entrancing kiss , to atone for the unwitting treason . Even thus I would not be content . I wanted words as well . "

154857	155267	154826	154826	you	3763	" And it was true . And so it was with me . I told her father that same night . And now in the heaven of gladness and wild pleasure , beyond all dreams of earth , opened the hell of my wickedness and crime ; which but for mercy and long repentance would sever me from my Lily in the world to come . To some the crime may seem a light one , to me it is a most atrocious sin , enhanced tenfold by its awful consequences . By my crime , I do not mean my sinful adoration , as cold men may call it , of a fellow mortal . Nature has no time to waste , and unless she meant my Lily to be worshipped , she would not have lavished all her skill in making her so divine . No , I mean my black deceit , in passing for my brother . Oh , Clara , do n't go from me . Like many another ruinous sin , it was committed without thought , or rather without deliberation . No scheme was laid , not even the least intention cherished ; but the moment brought it , and the temptation was too great . Who could have that loving pet gazing at him so , and not sell his soul almost to win her to his arms ? Laurence Daldy was a lazy ass . I do not want to shift my blame to him , but merely state a fact . If he had not been a lazy ass , your father would be living now - ay , and my Fiordalisa . When he chose , he could write very good Italian , and a clear , round hand , and oh , rare accomplishment for an officer , he could even spell . But his letter to Signor Dezio , scrawled betwixt two games of pool , was a perfect magpie 's nest of careless zigzag , wattles , and sand slap - dash . In those days a hasty writer used to flick his work with sand , which stanched but did not dry the ink . The result was often a grimy dabble , like a child 's face blotched with blackberries . Lily and I had quite arranged how we should present ourselves . Like two children we rehearsed it under the twilight trees . "
155274	155280	155281	155281	I	0	" my sweet love whispered , "

155363	155574	155344	155344	I	0	" she always called me from the moment she confessed her love ; and so , no doubt , she is calling me now in heaven . The curtain hung in heavy folds across the narrow doorway of the long dark room . The hospitable board was gay with wine and dainty fruit , melons , figs , and peaches , plums of golden and purple hue , pomegranates , pomi d'oro , green almonds , apricots , and muscatels from the ladders of Cape Corso . Through them and upon them played the mellow light from a single lamp , with dancing lustres round it . All the rest of the room was dark . At the head of the table sat Signor Dezio Della Croce , waiting for his guest and daughter . Posted high at the end window on a ledge of rough - hewn board , stood the ancient warder , who had lived for fifty years among them , and whose great fusil commanded the only approach to the castle . As we entered timidly , the maiden 's right hand on my neck , my left arm round her ductile waist , our other hands clasped firmly , I glanced toward that noxious sentinel . "
155603	155699	155597	155597	he	3770	" Signor Dezio looked amazed , as we glided towards him . His life had been one series of crushing blows from heaven . Three brave sons had been barbarously murdered in Vendetta , and his graceful loving wife had broken her heart and died . The sole hope of his house , his petling Fiordalisa , though she called herself a woman and was full sixteen , he looked upon her still in his trouble - torn chronology , as only ripe enough to be dandled on his lap . Still he called her his "
155702	155917	155597	155597	he	3770	" and sang nannas to her , as he had been obliged to do after her mother 's death . As he sat there , too astonished to smile , or frown , or say a word , Lily dropped upon her knees before him , as a Grecian maiden would . We English are not supple - jointed ; but for Lily 's sake , I could not stand beside her . Then she placed her soft right hand in the centre of my hard palm , flung the other arm round my neck , and with her eyes upon her father 's , gave me a long affectionate kiss . This done , she drew her father 's head down , and kissed his snow - white beard . Now , she told me , after this , any father who is obdurate , must according to institution blame himself and no one else , if harm befall the maiden . All this time , I spoke not , and thought of nothing except to screen my Lily . Signor Dezio kept a stately silence , but the tears were in his eyes , and the long white beard was quivering . Lily bent her head , and waited for his words . "

156158	156375	156151	156151	you	1611	" The old chief bowed his head in thought . He had lost his last surviving son by neglecting the Spalla 's decree . The Spalla is the shoulder blade of a goat , polished , and used for divination ; upon it had been read Sampiero 's death , and the destiny of Napoleon . The old man who had forecast the latter was still alive , and of immense renown , and traversed the island now like an ancient prophet . He was the hoary goatherd of Ghidazzo . Lily saw that she was conquering ; she leaped upon her father 's knee and hugged him ; and her triumph was complete . While she wept upon his breast , and told him all her little tale , and whispered in his ear , and while he kissed , and comforted her , and thought of her dear mother , I rushed out and leaped the Vinea , and wept beneath the olive - trees . At last the old man rose and called me , he durst not venture from the door ; but he did what was far better , he sent my own love after me . At length when we returned , and we found cause not to hurry , - "

156398	156411	156392	156397	a man of very keen observation	3782	" - Lily 's eyes gave me a twinkle full of fun - "
156543	156544	156575	156576	Signor beloved	614	" "
156549	156572	156575	156576	Signor beloved	614	" was on my lips , but Lily 's glance just saved it . And I thought of his three brave sons . "
156625	156667	156612	156612	she	3772	" I saw nothing of the sort , but a blooming maiden figure , growing lovelier every day . Poor Lily dropped her long eyelashes , and smiled through a glowing blush . So blushed Lavinia under the eyes of Turnus . "
156780	156850	156765	156765	you	5306	" He looked at me inquiringly . Instead of explaining that I was only the brother of the great Signor Valentino , I bowed , alas I bowed with a hot flush on my cheeks . What could it matter , and why should I interrupt him , if he chose to deceive himself ? Lily charmed away all hesitation , by clapping her little hands , and crying , "
156859	156860	156854	156854	I	0	" "
156981	157308	156953	156954	my flower	3811	" A load of terror was off my heart - I thought he was going to bind me to the accursed Vendetta . Even for my Lily , I could hardly have taken that pledge . So I assented readily to the last stipulation , though it was based upon a virtual lie of mine . But with Lily 's eyes upon me , brimming as they were with tears at the first condition , and her round arms trembling to enfold me , could I stick at anything short of downright murder ? The first proviso I fought against in vain . Even Lily coaxed and cried , without any good effect . When at last we yielded to the stern decree , the venerable father , as we knelt before him , joined our hands together , and poured a blessing on us , which I did not lack . He had given me my blessing . After this we sat down to supper , and the trusty musketeer , who had watched the whole scene grimly , and without hearing all , knew what the result was , he , I say , upon his perch began to improvise , or haply to adapt , and sing to a childish air , some little verses upon the glad occasion . Having exhausted his stock , down he leaped without permission , and drank our health in a bumper of Luri wine . Lily was now in due course of promotion . No longer was she the handmaid , whose eyes created and rejoiced in countless mistakes of mine . Now she was sitting by my side , as she had good right to be , and was lost in pretty raptures at my gallant attentions . They were very nice , she owned , but thoroughly un - Corsican . How I wished her father and the old fusileer away ! CHAPTER XI . "
157329	157330	157325	157327	some lovelier maiden	3814	" "
157348	157369	157345	157345	I	0	" She showed a small stiletto toy with a cross upon the handle , and ground her pearly teeth together . "
157379	157380	157384	157384	Lily	615	" "
157387	157388	157384	157384	Lily	615	" "
157405	157406	157384	157384	Lily	615	" "
157425	157517	157409	157409	you	0	" And so we spent the precious time , - ten days allowed me to prepare my yacht - in talking utter nonsense , and conning fifty foolish schemes , to make us seem together . I was for departing at once , that the period might begin to run ; but Lily was for keeping me to the last possible moment , and of course she had her way . It was fixed that I should sail on the 10th day of September . My little boat , now called the "
157521	160239	157409	157409	you	0	" was brought from Calvi , and moored in a secluded cove , where my love could see it from her bedroom window . It was no longer Corsican law that I should live in the castle . The privileges of a guest were gone ; and the rigorous code of suitorship began . But to me and my own darling it made very little difference . I never left Vendetta tower , as I lightly named it , until my pet was ordered off to bed ; and every morn I climbed the heights , after a long swim in the sapphire ripple , and met my own sweet Lily sparkling from the dew of her early toilet . How she loved me , how I loved her ; which more than other let angels say ; for we could not decide . That ancient Corsican her father , albeit little versed in books , was as upright and downright a gentleman as ever knew when his presence was not required . Therefore he took my word of honour for his Lily 's safety ; and left her to her own sweet will ; and her sweet will was to spend with me all her waking hours . For her as yet there was no fear of the blood - avenger . According to their etiquette they can not shoot the daughter , until they have shot the father . As to the sons the restriction does not hold . The feud we were concerned in had lasted now 120 years , and cost the lives of 130 people . It lay between the ancient races of Della Croce , and De Gentili , and owed its origin to the discovery of a dead mule on the road to church . The question was which family should be exterminated first . For many years the house of Della Croce had been in the ascendant , having produced a long succession of good shots and clever bushmen . At one time all the hopes of the De Gentili hung upon one infant life , which was not thought worth the taking . Fatal error - that one life had proved a mighty trump . One after one the Della Croce fell before that original artist , who invented a patent method of trunking himself in olive bark and firing from a knot - hole . Many a story Lily told me of his devilish wiles ; and in those stories I rejoiced , because she clung around my neck , and trembled so that I must hold her . Happily now this olive - branch was dead , having received his death - wound while he administered one to Lily 's youngest brother . Ever since that , the feud had languished , and strict etiquette required that the Della Croce should perpetrate the next murder . But her father , said my Lily , with her sweet head on my breast and her soft eyes full of fire , her father did not seem to care even to shoot the cousin of the man who had shot her brothers . Darling Lily , my blood runs cold , even with your beauty in my arms , to hear you talk of murder so . Own pet , I shall change you . You heaven meant for love , and softness , and delight : human devilry has tainted even you . It was not an easy task to change her . Of all human passions revenge is far the strongest . Clara , how your eyes flash . You ought to have been a Corsican . It was not an easy task ; but love loves difficulties . In my ten short days of delicious wretchedness , almost I taught Fiordalisa to despise revenge . And what do you think availed me most ? Not the Bible . No , her mind and soul were swathed by Popery in the rags of too many saints . What helped me most , and the only thing that helped me at all , except caresses , was the broad and free expanse of the ever changing sea . Her nature was all poetry , her throbbing breast an Idyl . Upon my little quarter - deck I had a cushioned niche for her , and there we sat and steered ourselves while the sailors slept below . Alone upon the crystal world , pledged for life or death together , drinking deepest draughts of passion and thirsting still for more , what cared we for petty hatreds , we whose all in all was love ? How she listened as I spoke , how her large eyes grew enlarged . At last those eyes , pure wells of love , were troubled with hot tears . The fatal day was come . Tokens we had interchanged , myriad vows , and countless pledges , which even love could scarce remember . With all the passion of her race , and all the fervour of the clime , she bared her beautiful round arm , the part that lay most near the heart and touched it with the keen stiletto , then she threw her breast on mine , and I laid the crimsoned ivory on my lips . How the devil - excuse me , Clara - how the devil I got away , only phlegmatic Englishmen can tell . No Frenchman , or Italian , would have left that heavenly darling so . We put it off to the last moment , till it was quite dangerous to pass the rocky jaws . As my bad luck would have it , there was a purpling sunset breeze . My own love on the furthest point , her white feet in the water , growing smaller and smaller yet , and standing upon tiptoe to be seen for another yard ; my own darling love of ages , she loosed her black hair down her snowy vest , for me to know her from the rocks behind ; then she waved and waved her sweet palm hat , fragrant of my Lily , - I had kissed every single inch of it , - until she thought I could not see her ; and then , as my telescope showed me , back she fell upon a ledge of rocks , and I could see or fancy her delicious bosom heaving to the fury of her tears . We glided past the cavern mouth , and the silver beach beyond it , whence we had often watched the sunset ; and then a beetling crag took from me the last view of Lily . However long the schoolboy may have bled from some big coward 's bullying , or the sway of the rustling birch and the bosky thrill that follows , however sore he may have wept while hung head - downwards through the midnight hours , with a tallow candle between his teeth , or in the pang of nouns heteroclite and brachycatalectic dinners ; yet despite these minor ills , his fond heart turns through after life to the scene of foot - ball and I - spy , to the days when he could jump or eat any mortal thing . And so it is with bygone love . Even the times of separation or of bitter quarrel , the aching heart whereon the keepsake lies , the spasms of jealousy , the tenterhooks of doubt ; remembrance looks upon them all as treasures of a golden age . Over the darkening sea , we bore away for Sardinia . Hours and hours , I gazed upon the cushions , where my own pet darling used to lean and love me . To me they were fairer than all the stars , or the phosphorescent sea . From time to time our Corsican pilot kept himself awake , by chanting to strangely mournful airs some of the voceros or dirges , the burden of many ages in that lamenting land . Fit home for Rachel , Niobe , or Cassandra , where half a million gallant beings , twice the number of the present population , have fallen victims to the blood - revenge . So Corsican historians tell ; a thousand violent deaths each year , for the last five centuries . Sometimes the avenger waits for half a lifetime , lurking till his moment comes . Before his victim has ceased to quiver , or the shot to ring down the rocky pass , he is off for the bush or the mountains , and leads thenceforth a bandit 's life . They tell me , Clara , that things are better now , and this black stain on a chivalrous race is being purged by Christian civilization . Be it as it may , I love the island of my Lily still ; and hope , please God , to see it once more , before I go to her . Banished though I was , for the present , from the only place I cared for , it seemed still greater severance to go further than I could help . Therefore instead of returning to England , I spent the winter in cruising along the western coast of Italy , and the south of Spain ; and coasted back to Genoa . To Seville , and other places famed for beautiful women , I made especial trips , to search for any fit to compare with my own maiden . Of course I knew none could be found ; but it gave me some employment , and bitter pleasure , to observe how inferior were all . To my eyes , bright with one sweet image , no other form had grace enough to be fit pillow for my charmer 's foot . How I longed and yearned for some fresh token of her : all her little gifts I carried ever in my bosom , but never let another 's eyes rest one moment on them . Not even would I tell my friends one word about my love ; it seemed as if it would grow common by being talked about . To Peter Green I wrote , resigning my commission , although I did not tell him that I had found the olives . No , friend Peter , those olives are much too near my Lily ; and I wo n't have you or any other stranger there . I know she would not look at you ; still I would rather have you a thousand miles away . Free trade , if you like , when I have made my fortune ; which by the bye is somewhat the maxim of that school . My fortune , not in olives , oil , or even guineas - all that rubbish you are welcome to - but my fortune where my heart and soul are all invested , and now , no more my fortune , but my certain fate in Lily . At length and at last my calendar - like a homesick pair at school , we had made one for each other , thanking God that it was not a leap - year - my calendar so often counted , so punctually erased , began to yield and totter to the stubborn sap of time . My patience long ago had yielded , my blood was in a fever . Another thing began to yield , alas it was my money . Green , Vowler , and Green had behaved most liberally ; but of course the expenses of my vessel had been heavy on me ; and now my salary had ceased . Peter Green wrote to me in the kindest and most handsome manner , pressing me , if tired as he concluded of those murderous Corsicans , to accept another engagement in Sardinia . Even without imparting my last discovery , I had done good service to the firm . I smiled at the idea of my being weary of Corsicans : even now the mere word sends a warm tide to my heart . It was not for the beauty of the scene , or the works of art , that I remained in Genoa ; but because it was the likeliest place to see the Negro 's head . As we lay at the end of the mole , my glass commanded all that entered ; and every lugger or xebec that bore the sacred emblem - off my little dingy pushed from our raking stern , and with one man , now my friend because a thorough Corsican , I boarded her , at all hazards of imprisonment ; and craved for tidings of the sacred land . Although , of course , I would not show the nest of all my thoughts , yet by beating about the bush , I got some scraps of news . The great Signor was flourishing , and had harvested an enormous crop of olives : his lovely daughter , now becoming the glory of the island , had been ill of something like marsh - fever , but was now as blooming as the roses . They did say , but the captain could not at all believe it , that she had been betrothed to some foreign olive - merchant . What disgrace ! The highest blood and the sweetest maid in Corsica , to be betrayed to an oilman ! Plenty of other news I gathered - the good people are great gossips - but this was all I cared for . Meanwhile your father , Clara dear , replied most warmly to my letter , sending me a sum on loan , which quite relieved me from cheese - paring . And now the wind was in the north , and it was almost time to start for the arms of Lily . If I waited any longer , I should be too mad to bear the voyage . At the break of day we left the magnificent harbour , and the cold wind from the maritime Alps chilled all but the fire of love . Up and down the little deck , up and down all day and night ; sleep I never would again , until I touched my Lily . On the evening of the 8th of March , we were near Cape Corso ; next day we coasted down the west to the lively breeze of spring , and so upon the 9th we moored to the tongue of Calvi . At midnight we were under way , and when the sun could reach the sea over the snowy peaks , we glided past the mountain crescent that looks on the Balagna . In the early morning still , when the dew was floating , we rounded the gray headland of Signor Dezio 's cove , and I climbed along the bowsprit to glance beyond the corner . What is that white dress I see fluttering at the water 's edge ? Whose is that red - striped mandile tossed on high and caught again ? And there the flag - staff I erected , with my colours flying ! Only one such shape on earth - only two such arms - out with the boat or I must swim , or run the yacht ashore . The boat has been towing alongside for the last six hours : Lily ca n't wait for the boat any more than I can . From rock to rock she is leaping ; which is the nearest one ? Into the water she runs , then away in blushing terror - she forgot all about the other men . But I know where to find her , she has dropped her little shoe , she must be in my grotto . There I press her to my heart of hearts , trembling , weeping , laughing , all unable to get close enough to me . "
160253	160262	160263	160263	My	0	" Her voice is like a silver bell . "
160280	160583	160277	160277	you	3819	" If she were lovely when I left her , what shall I call her now ? There is not one atom of her but is pure perfection . I hold her from me for one moment , to take in all her beauties . She has a most delicious fragrance that steals upon my senses . Toilet bottles she never heard of ; what she has is nature 's gift , and unperceived except by love . I have often told her of it , but she wo n't believe it . It is not your breath , you darling ; your breath is only violets ; it comes from every fibre of you , even from your hair ; it is as when the wind has kissed a lily of the valley . The ancient Signor being a man of very keen observation , did not delay our wedding any longer than could be helped . That evening we hauled down the family fusileer , gave him a goblet of wine , and sent him about his business : for one night we would take our chance even of Vendetta . At supper - time the Signor was in wonderful spirits , and drank our health with many praises of our constancy and obedience . One little fact he mentioned worth a thousand propinations ; his daughter 's fever had been cured by some chance news of me . He even went away to fetch a bottle of choicest Rogliano , when he saw how I was fidgetting to get my arm round Lily . Then after making his re - entrance , with due clumsiness at the door , he quite disgraced himself , while drawing the cork , by even winking at me , as he said abruptly , "
160594	160611	160616	160616	you	604	" My Lily blushed , I must confess , but did not fence with the question . "
160630	161037	160625	160626	my love	1653	" But she would not look at me to ask . In the porch she whispered to me , that it was only from her terror of the bad Lepardo coming . Did the loving creature fancy that I would believe it ? Once more we sailed together over the amethyst sea ; she was as fond of the water as a true - born Briton . In her thoughts and glances was infinite variety . None could ever guess the next thing she would say . Thoroughly I knew her heart , because I lived therein , and sweeter lodgings never man was blessed with . But of her mind she veiled as yet the maiden delicacies , strictly as she would the glowing riches of her figure . What amazed me more than all , was that while most Corsican girls are of the nut - brown order , no sun ever burned the snowy skin of Lily : she always looked so clear and clean , as if it were impossible for anything to stain her . Clara , you are always talking of your lovely Isola . I wonder where she got her name : it is no stranger to me . Something in your description of her reminds me of my Lily . I long to see the girl : and you must have some reason for so obstinately preventing me . CHAPTER XII . Though Lily and I were most desirous to keep things as quiet as possible , by this time our engagement was talked of in every house of the Balagna . That paternal fusileer and my merry yachtsmen , although they looked the other way whenever we approached , would not permit the flower of Corsica , as she was now proclaimed , to blush with me unseen . My sailors attended to her far more than to their business , and would have leaped into the water for one smile of Lily . It is the fashion of the island to make a wedding jubilee ; and the Signor was anxious to outdo all that had ever been done . We , absorbed in one another , did our best to disappoint him ; but he scorned the notion of any private marriage . I never shall forget how he knit his silver brows when I made a last attempt to bring him to our views . "
161132	161822	161126	161126	I	0	" The Corsicans are a most excitable race , and , when affronted , seem to lash their sides as they talk . By the time the good Signor had finished his speech , every hair of his beard was curling with indignation . But his daughter sprang into his arms and kissed away the tempest , and promised , if it must be so , to make herself one mass of gold and coral . So the Parolanti , or mediators , were invoked ; an armistice for a week was signed , and honour pledged on either side . Free and haughty was the step of the Signor Dezio as he set forth for the town to order everything he could see ; and very wroth again he was , because I would not postpone the day for him to get a shipload of trumpery from Marseilles . This time I was resolved to have my way . Besides the fervour of my passion and my dread of accidents , the one thing of all others I detest is to be stared at anywhere . And it is far worse to be stared at by a foreign race . The Corsicans are gentlemen by nature , but they could not be expected to regard without some curiosity the lucky stranger who had won their Lily . I will not weary you , as I myself was wearied , with all the ceremonies of the wedding - day . All I wanted was my bride , and she wanted none but me : yet we could not help being touched by the hearty good - will of the commune . The fame of Lily 's beauty had spread even to Sardinia , and many a handsome woman came to measure her own thereby . Clever as they are at such things , not one of them could find a blemish or defect in Lily , and our fair Balagnese told them to go home and break their mirrors . It was a sweet spring morning , and amid a fearful din of guns and trumpets , mandolins and fiddles , I waited with a nervous smile under the triumphal arch in front of my fictitious house . A sham house had been made of boards , and boughs , and flowers , because it is most essential that the bride should be introduced to the bridegroom 's dwelling . Here I was to receive the procession , which at last appeared . First came fifty well - armed youths , crowned with leaves and ribbons ; then four - and - twenty maidens dressed alike , singing and scattering flowers , and then a boy of noble birth , mounted on a pony , and carrying the freno , symbol of many scions . None of them I looked at ; only for my Lily . On a noble snow - white palfrey , decked from head to foot with flowers , her father walking at her side , came the bloom , the flower , the lily of them all , arrayed in clear white muslin , self - possessed , and smiling . One glorious wreath was round her head ; it was her own black hair by her own sweet fingers twined with sprigs of myrtle . A sash , or fazoletto , of violet transparent crape , looped at the crown of her head , fell over the shy lift of her bosom , parting like a sunset cloud , where the boddice opened below the pear - like waist . To me she looked like a white coralline rising through an amethyst sea . Behind her came the authorities of the commune . The sham keys were already hanging at her slender zone . It was my place to lift her down and introduce her formally . This I did with excellent grace , feeling the weight of eyes upon me . But when I got her inside , I spoiled the folds of the fazoletto . I heard the old man shouting , "
161881	161882	161885	161886	old fellow	3832	" "
161907	161926	161927	161927	Friends	2580	" One more virgin kiss , and with Lily on my arm , forth I sally to respond . "
161962	161963	161954	161955	the priest	6724	" "
161978	162178	162187	162187	him	3839	" No more delay . The maids have got all they can do to keep in front of us with their flowers . The armed youths stand on either side at the entrance to the church . The tapers are already lit , the passage up the little church is strewed with flowering myrtle . Lily , holding her veil around her , walks hand in hand with me . Fiordalisa Della Croce now is Lily Vaughan ; amidst a world of shouting , shooting , and cornamusas , we are led to the banqueting - room ; there they seat us in two chairs , and a fine fat baby is placed on Lily 's lap , to remind her of her duties . She dandles it , and kisses it as if she understood the business , and then presents it with a cap of corals and gay ribbons . Now Lily Vaughan throws off her fazoletto , and gives me for a keepsake the myrtles in her hair . Then all who can claim kin with her , to the fortieth generation , hurry up and press her hand , and wish the good old wish . "
162194	162615	162616	162618	Fiordalisa Della Croce	604	" After the banquet , we were free to go , having first led off the ballo in the Cerca dance . Thank God , my Lily is at last my own ; she falls upon my bosom weary and delighted . Clara , remember this : the little church in which we were married is called St. Katharine 's on the cliff ; and I signed the record in my proper name , Edgar Malins Vaughan : the Malins , very likely , they did not know from Valentine , for I always wrote it with a flourish at the end . The Signor , with all his friends , escorted us to the limits of his domain ; there we bade them heartily farewell , and they returned to renew the feast . My little yacht was in the bay , and we saw the boat push off to fetch us as had been arranged . We were to sail for Girolata , where the Signor had a country - house , lonely enough even for two such lovers . Three or four hours would take us thither , and the sun was still in the heavens . As no one now could see us , Lily performed a little dance for my especial delight . How beaming she looked , how full of spirits , now all the worry was over . Then she tripped roguishly at my side to the winding rocky steps that lead to St. Katharine 's cove . The cove was like a well scooped in the giant cliffs . As we descended the steep and narrow stairs , my Lily trembled on my arm . The house and all the merry - makers were out of sight and hearing . Of course we stopped every now and then , for the boat could not be at the landing yet , and we had much to tell each other . As we stepped upon the beach , and under the eaves of a jutting rock , a tall man stood before us . His eyes and beard were black as jet , and he wore the loose dress of a Southern seaman . Three sailors , unmistakeably English , were smoking and playing cards in the corner shade of the cliff . Lily started violently , turned pale , and clung to me , but faced the intruder bravely . He was quite amazed at her beauty , I at his insolent gaze . "
162620	162629	162616	162618	Fiordalisa Della Croce	604	" he said with a pure Tuscan accent , "
162640	162671	162633	162633	I	0	" He actually laid his small , but muscular hand upon my Lily 's shoulder . She leaped back as from a snake . I knew it must be Lepardo . "
162674	162684	162633	162633	I	0	" I said , as calmly as I could , "
162694	162719	162633	162633	I	0	" The sneering , supercilious look which he hardly deigned to spare me , was honest , compared to his foul stare at her . "
162748	163886	162746	162746	her	3844	" And he thrust his filthy , hairy lips under my own pet 's hat . My muscles leaped , and my soul was in the blow . Down he went like a flail , and I thought he was stunned for an hour ; but while I was bearing my pet to the boat , which now was close to the beach , up he leaped , and rushed at me with a dagger - a dagger like one which you know . I did not see him , but Lily did over my shoulder ; she sprang from my arms and flung herself between us . He thrust her aside , and leaped at me like a panther , aiming straight at my heart . How he missed me I can not tell , but think it was through Lily . Before he recovered , I closed with him , wrested away the weapon and flung it far into the sea . But one main thing I omitted ; I ought to have stunned him thoroughly . Into the boat with Lily - I caught up an oar , and away we dashed . The three English sailors were running up . As a wave took the boat about , one of them grasped the stern ; down on his knuckles crashed my oar , and with a curse he let go . All right , all clear , off for the yacht for your lives . I would show fight , for my blood is up , but what would become of Lily ? And we are but three against four , and none of us have arms . Meanwhile , that black Italian , I can never call him a Corsican , sneaked away to a tuft of sea - grass for his double - barrelled fusil . Bowing with all my might , I saw him examine the priming , lay his red cap on a rock , and the glistening gun on the cap , and , closing one eye , take steady aim , not at me , but at Lily . Poor Lily sat on the thwart at my side , faintly staring with terror . No time to think ; oar and all I dashed in front of my darling . A ping in the air , a jar on my wrist , a slight blow on my breast , and at my feet dropped the bullet . It had passed through the tough ash handle . Down , Lily , down , for God 's sake ; he is firing the other barrel . I flung her down in the bilge water ; the brute can not see her now . Not quite so easily off . Up a steep rock he climbed like a cat , the cursed gun still in his hand . He won fifty feet of vantage , and commanded the whole of the boat . We were not eighty yards away . There he coolly levelled at my prostrate Lily . I had grey hairs next morning . Forward , I threw myself , over my wife ; me he might kill if he chose . One lurch of the boat - a short sea was running - and my darling 's head was shown . He saw his chance and fired . Thank God , he had too little powder in ; my own love is untouched . The ball fell short of Lily , and passed through my left foot , in at the sole and out below the instep . Luckily I had retained my dancing shoes , or my thick boots would have kept the ball in my foot . The brute could not see that he had hit any one , and he cursed us in choice Italian . Poor Lily had quite swooned away , and knew nothing of my wound . Over the side of the yacht I lifted her myself , standing upon one leg . No one else should touch her . So furious I was with that cold - blooded miscreant , that if I could only have walked , I would have returned to fight him . My men , too , were quite up for it . But when Lily came to herself , and threw her arms round me and wept , and thanked God and her saints , I found my foot quite soaked in a pool of blood , and stiffening . Poor little dear ! what a fuss she did make about it ! I would have borne ten times the pain for the smiles and tears she gave me . One thing was certain - under the mercy of God , we owed our lives to each other , and held them henceforth in common . As , with a flowing sheet , we doubled the craggy point , concealed close under the rocks we saw a low and snake - like vessel , of the felucca build . She was banked for three pair of sweeps , and looked a thorough rover . This was , of course , Lepardo 's boat . We now bore away for Ajaccio , dear Lily having implored me not to think of Girolata , where no medical aid could anyhow be procured . Moreover , she wanted to fly from that dark Lepardo ; and I am quite willing to own that , despite my delicious nursing , I was not ambitious to stand as target again during our honeymoon . CHAPTER XIII . At first I thought a great deal more of the pain than the danger of my wound ; but when I showed it to the French surgeon at Ajaccio , he surprised me by shrugging his shoulders formidably , and declaring that it was the good God if I kept my foot . Being of a somewhat sceptical turn , I thought at first that he only wanted to gild the frame of his work ; but when I began to consider it , I found that he was quite right . The fact was , that I had thought much more of my bride than of my metatarsals . Two of these were splintered where the bullet passed between them , and it was a question whether it had not been poisoned . Many of the mountaineers are skilled in deadly drugs , and use them rarely for the bowl , not so rarely for the sword and gun . At one time there were symptoms even of mortification , and my wife , who waited hand and foot upon me , joined the surgeon in imploring me to submit to amputation . "
163962	164049	163956	163956	we	3847	" As she loved my toes so much , I resolved to keep them , if it was only for her sake ; and , after a narrow crisis , my foot began to get better . To her care and tenderness I owed my recovery , far more than to the skill of the clever surgeon . Six months elapsed before I could walk again , and our little yacht was sent to Calvi to explain the long delay . Fond as I was of the "
164054	164109	163956	163956	we	3847	" I was anxious now to sell her ; but my darling nurse , although she knew before our marriage that I was not a wealthy man , would not listen to the scheme at all ; for the doctor ordered me , as I grew stronger , to be constantly on the water . "
164176	166475	164164	164164	he	469	" Conscious as I was of my vile deceit , I would rather have died than apply to Signor Dezio , albeit I am quite sure that he would soon have forgiven me . So I wrote again to my good - natured brother and banker , and told him all that had happened , but begged him not to impart it even to your mother . I have strong reason for suspecting that he did not conceal it from her ; but as I never alluded to the subject before her , she was too much a lady ever to lead me towards it . My motive for this reserve was at first some ill - defined terror lest my fraud upon Signor Dezio should come to light prematurely . Also I hate to be talked about among people whom I despise . Afterwards , as you will perceive , I had other and far more cogent reasons . I need not say that your father - dear Clara , I ought to love you , if only on his account ! - your father wrote me a kind and most warm - hearted letter , accompanied by a most handsome gift - no loan this time , but a wedding - gift , and a very noble one . Also he pressed me to come home with my bride the moment I could endure the voyage . Ah ! if I had only obeyed him , not Lily and Henry , but myself would have been the victim . We returned as soon as possible to Vendetta tower , and found the good Signor in excellent spirits , delighted to see his sweet daughter again , and still more delighted by hope of a little successor to the gray walls and the olive groves . When this hope was realized , and a lusty young grandson was laid in his arms , he became so wild in his glory , that he went about boasting all over the commune , feasting all who came near him , forgetting the very name of the blood - revenge . Many a time we reminded and implored him to be more careful . He replied , that his life was of no importance now ; he had come to his haven among his own dear ones , and was crowning the old ship with flowers . Moreover , he knew that the De ' Gentili were of a nobler spirit than to shed the blood of a gray - haired man , when institution did not very loudly demand it . And so I believe they were . Alas ! the poor old man ! - a thorough and true gentleman as one need wish to see - choleric albeit , and not too wide of mind ; but his heart was in the right place , and made of the right material , and easy enough to get at . He was free to confess his own failings , and could feel for a man who was tempted . Deeply thankful I am that , before his white beard was laid low , I acknowledged to him my offence , and obtained his hearty forgiveness . Little Henry was on his lap , going off into smiles of sleep , with his mother 's soft finger in his mouth . At first my confession quite took the poor Signor aback ; for I did not attempt to gloss the dishonour of what I had done ; but I told him truly that the meanness was not in my nature , and although I had won my pet Lily , the road ran through hemlock and wormwood . And now I perceived how uncalled - for and stupid the fraud had been . When the old man recovered a little from the shock caused by the dishonesty - towards which recovery the tears of his daughter and the smiles of his grandson contributed - he was really glad to find that I was not a landed Signor . He rubbed his hands and twitched his beard with delight , for now his little Enrico would never be taken away to the barbarous English island . Was he not rightful successor to the lands of the Della Croce ? and what more could he possibly want ? What could he care for the property in Gloisterio ? However , he made us promise that if the present remarkable baby , Master Henry Vaughan , should ever enjoy the property in the unpronounceable county , Lily 's second child , if she had one , should take the Corsican lordships ; for his great fear was , that the Malaspina and Della Croce estates should become a servient tenement to the frozen fields of the North . To express and ensure his wishes , he had a deed - poll prepared according to his own fancy , read it to us and some witnesses , then signed , sealed , and enrolled it . This was one of the documents which you , my brave Clara , rescued from that vile , stealthy ghost . And now , for a short time , we enjoyed deep , quiet , delicious happiness . The crime which had haunted me was confessed and forgiven . Amply possessed of the means , and even the abundance of life , I was blessed with strong health again , and freedom among the free . Richest and best of all blessings , I had a sweet , most lovely , and most loving wife , and loved her once and for all . No more beautiful vision has any poet imagined than young Lily Vaughan sitting under the vine - leaves , her form more exquisite than ever , her soft - eyed infant in her lap wondering at his mother 's beauty , while her own deep - lustred eyes carried to her husband 's , without the trouble of thinking , all that flowed into her heart - joy at belonging to him , hope of bliss to come , fear of over - happiness , pride in all the three of us , and shame at feeling proud . Then a gay coquettish glance , as quick youth warms the veins , and some humorous thought occurs , a tickle for the baby , and a feint of cold - shouldering me . But , jealous as I was , desperately jealous , for my love was more passionate than ever , I can honourably state that Lily 's one and only trial to arouse my jealousy was an ignominious failure , recoiling only on the person of the dear designer . However exacting little Harry might be , I never grudged him his double share of attention . In the first place I looked upon him as a piece of me , still holding on ; and , in the next place , I knew that all he laid claim to was only a loan to him , and belonged in fee simple to his father . At this time I wrote to my brother again , announcing the birth of our boy , and that we had made him his namesake ; dispensing , too , with all further reserve on the subject of our marriage . This letter was never delivered to your dear father . That much I know , for certain ; and at one time I strongly suspected that our cold - blooded , crafty foe contrived to intercept it . But no ; if he had , he would have known better afterwards . After that cowardly onslaught upon my bride and myself , I had of course learned all I could of the history of this Lepardo . He was the only son of the Signor 's only brother , but very little was known of him in the neighbourhood , as he came from Vescovato on the east side of the island . He was said to have great abilities and very great perseverance , and under the guardianship of his uncle had been intended and partly educated for the French Bar . But his disposition was most headstrong and sullen ; and at an early age he displayed a ferocity unusual even in a Corsican . Neither had he the great redeeming trait of the islanders , I mean their noble patriotism . One good quality , however , he did possess , and that was fidelity to his word . With one of the contradictions so common in human nature , he would even be false in order to be true : that is , he would be treacherous wherever he was unpledged , if it assisted him towards a purpose to which he was committed . While he was yet a boy , his intended career was cut short by an act of horrible violence . He disliked all the lower animals , horses and mules especially ; and one day he was detected by a master of the Paoli College , screaming , and yelling at , and lashing , from a safe distance , a poor little pony whom he had tied to a fence . The master , an elderly man , very humane and benevolent , rebuked him in the most cutting manner , and called him a low coward . The young villain ran off , with his eyes flashing fire , procured a stiletto , and stabbed the poor man in the back . Then he leaped on the horse he had been ill - treating , and pricking him with the dagger , rode away furiously in the direction of Bastia . The pursuers could not trace him through the wild mountain district , but it was believed that he reached the town and took refuge in an English brig , which was lying off the harbour , and sailed for Genoa that evening . The pony was found dead , lying by the roadside with the brute 's dagger in its throat . No wonder Lily , who told me all this , with true Corsican rage in her eyes , no wonder my Lily hated him . Even as a little girl , for she was but ten years old when he disappeared , she always felt a strong repugnance towards him . He was about six years older than Fiordalisa , and four years younger than I ; so when he shot at Lily , he must have been three - and - twenty . It was reported that after his disappearance he took to a sea - faring life , and made himself very useful , by his knowledge of languages , in the English merchant service . Quarrelling with his employers , he was said to have resorted to smuggling in the Levant , if not to downright piracy . Clara , for reasons I can not explain , I wish you to follow my story step by step in its order , noting each landing - place . To do this with advantage , you must have the dates carved upon each of the latter : therefore I beg you to copy them as you pass . I arrived in Corsica , as you heard , during the month of May , 1829 . On the 12th of August in that same year I first beheld my Lily . That day I remember , beside other reasons , because I had wondered , as I rode idly along , whether my brother was opening his usual Highland campaign , and whether he would like to shoot the muffrone . Lily and I were married on the 21st of March , 1830 , when I was twenty - seven years old : and our little Henry first saw the light on the 24th of December following , more than two years before your birth . Your father having no children as yet , I looked upon my Harry as heir presumptive to these estates . Although your birth appeared to divest him of the heirship , it has since , through causes then unknown to me , proved otherwise ; and if he were living now , he would in strict law be entitled to this property after my death . But if he were alive , he never should have an inch of it , that is if I could prevent it ; because in strict righteousness all belongs to you . And now I hold the property in fee simple , under an Act which abolishes fines and recoveries ; for I have suffered so much from remorse , ever since your dear mother 's death , that even before you saved my life , dearest child , I enrolled a deed in Chancery , which gives me disposing powers ; and as I think you know , I made thereupon a will devising the lands to you . This also was one of the documents you caught that vile hypocrite stealing . To return to the old Signor . He was now as happy as the day was long , and desirous , as an old man often is , to set on foot noteworthy schemes , which might survive his time . Of this desire I took advantage to inoculate him with some English views . It was rather late to learn another catechism , at threescore years and five ; but a green old age was his , hale and hearty as could be . "

How could he come and pretend to love her , and pretend to marry her , when all the while he had a young wife at home in England ? Never would she have believed it but for the proofs , the proofs that hateful man had shown her . How could he shame his own love so , and his children , and the aged father - there was no hope for her but to die - to die and never see him more ; and then perhaps he would be sorry , for he must care about her a little .

At every sigh of yours , I shiver ; your smiles are all my sunshine . Let me feel some sunshine , sweetest ; you know how I used to love it , and as yet you have sent me none .

174228	174626	174219	174219	I	0	" SIR , - I am reluctant to obtrude good counsel , but with the obtuseness of your nation you are prone to the undervaluing of others . It is my privilege to amend this error , while meekly I revindicate my own neglected rights . From me you have stolen my bride and my good inheritance , and in a manner which the persons unversed in human nature would be inclined to characterise as dastardly and dissolute . Furthermore , you have rendered the heiress of the noblest house in Corsica a common Englishman 's adulteress . If I had heard this on the day of your mocking marriage , not the poor victim but you , you , would have been my direction . Now I will punish you more gradually , and longer , as you deserve . Your unhappy adulteress knows the perfidy of your treachery , and your two poor bastards shall take refuge with me . The inquiry with respect to my drowning them to - night is dependent upon the stars . But if I shall spare them , as I may , because they can not come between me and my property , I will teach them , when they are old enough , to despise and loathe your name . They shall know that in the stead of a father 's love they have only had a vagabond 's lust , and they shall know how you seduced and then slew their mother ; for death , in my humble opinion , appears in her face to - night . Although she has betrayed me , I am regretful for her : but to you who have disgraced my name and plundered me , as a man of liberal and exalted views I grant a contemptuous forbearance ; so long , that is to say , as you remain unhappy , which the wicked ought to be . Of one thing , however , I bid you to take admonishment . If I hear that you ever forget this episode of debauchery , and return to your English wife and property , no house , no castle that ever was edified , shall protect you from my dagger . Remember the one thing , as your proverb tells , I am slow and sure . LEPARDO DELLA CROCE . "
175107	175138	175102	175103	the fool	4251	" When at length we reach the Maltese capital - where I was not sorry to hear once more my native tongue - we found the felucca snugly moored near the "
175143	176084	176085	176085	Lily	615	" and being refitted as a pleasure - boat for a wealthy Englishman . This gentleman knew a good deal about ships , but not quite enough . Pleased with the graceful lines and clean run of the felucca , he had given nearly twice her value for her ; as he soon perceived when the ship - carpenters set to work . He was in the vein to afford all possible information , being thoroughly furious with the condemnable pirates - as he called them , without the weakness of the composite verb - who had robbed him so shamefully of his money . He told me that my children had been ashore , and Harry was much admired and kissed in the Floriana . One thing the sailors did which would have surprised a man unacquainted with the Corsicans , or perhaps I should say the islanders of the Mediterranean . They decked my little babe with flowers and ribands , and bore her in procession to the church of St. John of Jerusalem ; and there they had her baptized , for Lepardo had found out that she had never undergone the ceremony . I was anxious to see the record , but was not allowed to do so ; therefore I do not know what the little darling 's name is , if she be still alive : but they told me that the surname entered was not Vaughan , but Della Croce . It was said that the sailors had become very fond of her , the little creature being very sweet - tempered and happy , and a pleasing novelty to them . Very likely they named her after their own felucca . The crew being now dispersed , some to their homes , and some on board ships which had sailed , I was thrown completely off the scent . All I could learn , at a house which they had frequented , was that Lepardo , the commander , had long ago left the island . Whither , or in what ship , he had sailed , they could not or would not tell me : he had always plenty of money , they said , and he spent it like a prince . But Petro , who was a much better ferret than I , discovered , or seemed to have done so , that the kidnapper and murderer had taken passage for Naples . My heart fell when I heard it ; almost as easily might I have tracked him in London . At Naples I had spent a month , and knew the lying ingenuity , the laziness in all but lies , of its swarming thousands . However , the little yacht was again put under way , and , after a tedious passage , we saw the Queen of cities . Here , as I expected , the pursuit was baffled . I will not weary you with my wanderings , off more often than on the track , up and down the Mediterranean , and sometimes far inland . If I marked them on a map , however large the scale , you would have what children call a crinkly crankly puzzle , like Lancashire in Bradshaw . Once , indeed , I rested at the ancient tower , near my Lily 's grave , which I always visited twice in every year . I have some vague idea , now in my old age , that though we Vaughans detest any display of feeling - except indeed at times when the heart is too big for the skin - we are in substance , without knowing it , a most romantic race . Whether we are that , or not , is matter of small moment ; one thing is quite certain , we are strutted well and stable . We are not quick of reception , but we are most retentive . Never was there man of us who ever loved a woman and cast her off through weariness ; never was there woman of our house who played the jilt , when once she had passed the pledge of love . And after all I have seen of the world , and through my dark misfortune few men have seen more , it is my set conclusion that strong tenacity is the foremost of all the virtues . My enemy has it , I freely own , and through all his wickedness it saves him from being contemptible . For a time , as I said before , I paused from my continual search , and abode in the old gray tower . That search now appeared so hopeless , that I was half inclined to believe no better policy could be found than this . Some day or other the robber would surely return and lay claim to the lands of the Della Croce . At present he durst not do it , while under the ban of piracy and the suspicion of his uncle 's murder . Moreover , I thought it my duty to see to the welfare of my children 's property . Under the deed - poll of the old Signor , his friend at Prato and myself were trustees and guardians . But I could not live there long : it was too painful for me to sit alone in the desolate rooms where my children ought to be toddling , or to wander through the shrubberies and among the untended flowers , every one of them whispering "
176087	176494	176085	176085	Lily	615	" Formerly I had admired and loved that peculiar stillness , that rich deep eloquent solitude , which mantles in bucolic gray the lawns and glades of Corsica . But when I so admired and loved , I was a happy man , a man who had affection near him , and could warm himself when he pleased . Now though I had no friends or friendship , neither cared for any , solitude struck me to the bones , because it seemed my destiny . After striving for half a year to do my duty as a hermit Signor , I found myself , one dreary morning , fingering my pistols gloomily , and fitting a small bullet into my ear . My thumb caught in the guard of the Signor 's locket , and jerked it up my waistcoat . It was the same which the poor old man had pressed to his dying lips . There was Lily 's hair and Harry 's , and a tiny wisp of down since added , belonging to baby - name unknown . Looking at them and seeing how Lily 's bound them together and to me , I felt ashamed of my cowardly gloom , and resolved to quit myself like a man in my duty towards the three . I rode at once to Prato , and persuaded Count Gaffori to come and live at the tower . Like his old friend the Signor , he had only himself and his lovely daughter to think of ; but unlike Signor Dezio he had lost nearly all his paternal property , through political troubles . Therefore it was for him no little comfort and advantage to be placed at the head of a household again , and restored to some worldly importance . Nevertheless , his sense of honour was so nice and exacting , that I thought I should never succeed in bringing him to my views ; and indeed I must have failed but for his daughter 's assistance . A very sweet elegant girl she was , and she had been a great friend of my Lily 's . If I could ever have loved again , I should have loved that maiden : but the thing was impossible . The old Count promised to come and settle at Veduta tower - which name , in light days , I had corrupted into "
176496	176574	175102	175103	the fool	4251	" - and living there to assume the management of the estates , in trust for my lost infants , as soon as his arrangements could be made . I saw nothing that need have delayed him a day ; however , he declared that he must have a month to get ready , and he was plainly a man whom nature meant not to be pushed . So I employed the interval in having my dear old "
176576	176848	175102	175103	the fool	4251	" overhauled at Marseilles , coppered , and thoroughly painted . I could not bear to alter our little love - boat , as my darling called it , even in outward appearance ; but like our love she had laboured through many a tempest ; unlike it , she needed repairs . However , I saved from the painter 's brush our favourite quarter - deck bench , whereon through the moonlight watches my Lily seemed still to recline . And so my life for some years wandered on , a worthless , unsettled , forlorn existence , only refreshed at intervals by return to the scenes of past happiness . If I had really wronged Lepardo Della Croce , he could hardly have wished for a better revenge . But in truth I had never wronged him . Even if I had never come near his betrothed , it is quite certain she would not have accepted him . And he , by his own desertion , had left her free to choose . Late in the autumn of 1812 , when I had abandoned all hope of ever recovering my little ones , except by one of those eddies of Providence , which we men call accidents , and in which I place my confidence to this hour , at that season , I say , I landed at Gibraltar , being wind - bound in the straits . We were making for Lisbon , where I was to ship some English watches , guns , and fine cutlery for Ajaccio . What a loss of rank for the "
176851	177296	175102	175103	the fool	4251	" to turn her into a trading smack ! Well , I could not see it so ; and I am sure her late mistress , who with all her sweet romance was an excellent hand at a bargain , would have thought it far more below my dignity for me to sponge on our children . There was plenty of money in hand at Veduta tower ; but having retired from stewardship , I did not feel myself justified in drawing upon my children . Therefore , and for the sake of the large acquaintance and great opportunities gained , I had renewed my connection with the firm of Green , Vowler , and Green . Somehow , I could not bear to revisit the shores of England ; otherwise I am sure that with the knowledge I now possessed of the Mediterranean ports , and a house of such standing and enterprise to back me , I should quickly have made my fortune . My vessel , moreover , was much too small for the fruit - trade , even if I could have lowered her to an uncleanly freight ; but she was just the craft for valuable goods in small compass . I knew the Corsican fondness for arms and first - rate cutlery ; and the tools the poor Signor Dezio meant to astonish me with , certainly did astonish me by their wonderful badness . True , the material was good , but all the waters of the Restonica will not convert a hammer into a handsaw . Although hardware was not at all in his line of business , Peter Green most kindly undertook to send me a cargo of first - rate Sheffield and Birmingham goods , by a return fruit - schooner . These , consigned to his Lisbon agent , I could fetch away , as I pleased , or wanted them . Having arranged with a shrewd merchant of Ajaccio to take my goods wholesale , and save the dignity of all the Vogheni from haggling , I had already made six trips , and in spite of the most tyrannical douane perhaps in all the world , I as a Corsican , importing goods in a Corsican bottom , had cleared very nearly three hundred per cent . on my outlay . We were now on our seventh voyage , to reship the last of the second English consignment , when a violent gale from the west met us right in the teeth , and we were forced to bear up for the anchorage . A first - rate sea - boat the "
177298	177359	175102	175103	the fool	4251	" was , although she had been built for racing , and for two or three years had beaten all competitors , whenever there was wind enough for a cat to stand on the sheets . But one hot June day she got beaten in a floating match , when the lightest bung went fastest , and her prig of a "
177362	177708	175102	175103	the fool	4251	" sold her in disgust , and built a thing that drew as much water as a nautilus . In her he was happily upset , and could hardly find a sheet of paper to hold on by . Knowing some little about yachts , from my pool and reach experiences , I bought the famous racing cutter at about a quarter her value ; and even in these , her olden days , she could exhibit her taffrail to the smartest fruit - clipper - the name was then just invented - that ever raced for the Monument . Her register was fifty tons , but she carried eighty . Landing at Gibraltar , I kept clear of my countrymen , not that I dislike them , but because - well I can not tell why ; and strolled away to the Spanish and Moorish quarters . It was a windy evening , and in front of a low refreshment house some sailors and Spanish girls were dancing . A squabble arose among them ; something I think it was about a young girl 's dress . Knives were drawn , and two men were stabbed in less than the time I am speaking . I just saved the life of one , just saved it by half an inch . A fine - looking Spaniard lay under a Moor , who had tripped him up in their quick way . The point of the knife had flashed through the Spaniard 's shirt and his flesh was cut , before the swing of my stick - upwards luckily - had jerked the Moor off his body . If I had struck downwards , or a millionth part of a second later , the blade would have stood in the heart . But I knew those fellows by this time . The Moor lay senseless from the quick upper - cut on his temples , and the knife was quivering where the impulse had failed it . Now if Petro and I held deliberate choice - "
177710	177735	175102	175103	the fool	4251	" Oxford calls it - not to be turned into knife - sheaths , our only chance of developing into action that undeniable process of "
177738	177749	175102	175103	the fool	4251	" was to be found in the policy , vulgarly called "
177754	178579	175102	175103	the fool	4251	" At a shrill signal , from ship and from shore , the Moors came swarming silently and swiftly . Their yellow slippers and coffee - coloured legs seemed set upon springs by excitement . Some of the Spaniards stood bravely by us , and with their aid we hurried the wounded man into our boat , and pushed off just in time . Unlike the Corsican peasants , our pursuers carried no fire - arms , and before they could get any , we were at safe distance . Having sent for an English surgeon , we kept the poor sailor on board the yacht , until he was quite out of danger . We Britons are not , as a general rule , an over - grateful race ; we hate to be under an obligation , and too often illustrate the great philosopher 's saying , that the doer feels more good will than the receiver of a kindness . Moreover , the Spaniards , in the neighbourhood of the Rock , could hardly be expected to love us , even if we were accustomed , which it is needless to say we are not , to treat them with decent courtesy . Therefore I was surprised at the deep and warm gratitude of this wounded man . A thing that enhanced his debt to me - for life , in my opinion , is very little to owe - was that he loved a young girl , the one over whom they had quarrelled , and he was about to marry her . Discovering who I was , for he knew nothing of me at first , he saw that he could be of no little service to me . The only obstacle was a solemn oath ; but from this , he believed , he could soon obtain release . With an Englishman 's honest and honourable repugnance to any breach of faith , I was long reluctant to encourage this absolution . But the thought of my helpless children , robbed of their inheritance , and , still worse , of a father 's love , and dependant on the caprice of a superstitious villain , this , and the recollection of my desolating wrongs , overpowered all scruples . And is it not a wiser course , and more truly Christian , to port the helm than to cross the bows of another man 's religion , at any rate so long as it be Christian also , though frogged in a pensioner 's coat ? Being duly absolved - for which he would not allow me to pay - the Spanish sailor told me all he knew . He had been Lepardo 's mate , on many a smuggling run , and in many an act of piracy off the coast of Barbary . But he had never liked his captain , no one ever did ; though all the crew admired him as the cleverest man in the world . After the felucca was sold and her crew dispersed , the mate had followed for a while the fortunes of Lepardo . He told me things about him which I knew not how to believe . However , I will not repeat them , because they do not seem to bear upon my story . The name of my little girl he could not remember , for he was not at the christening , and she was always called the baby . Being a good - natured man he took kindly to the children , and told me anecdotes of them which brought the tears to my eyes . After two or three months spent at Naples , they all left suddenly for Palermo , on account , as the mate believed , of my unexpected arrival ; and here he lost sight of his commander , for tired by this time of an idle life , and seeing no chance of any more roving adventures , he accepted a berth in a brig bound for the Piraus , and now after many shifts and changes was first mate of a fruit vessel sailing from Zante to London . The most important part to me of all his communication was that , on their previous voyage , they had carried to England Lepardo Della Croce and my two dear children . That murderer and kidnapper had taken the lead in some conspiracy against the government of the Two Sicilies , and through the treachery of an accomplice had been obliged to fly for his life . Disguising himself he contrived to reach Gibraltar , and took refuge on English ground . He was now very poor and in great distress , but still clung to the children , of whom he appeared to be fond , and who believed him to be their father . The "
178582	178845	175102	175103	the fool	4251	" touching there , as usual , for supplies , Lepardo met his old mate ashore ; and begged for a passage to England . They took him to London , and there of course lost sight of him . He was greatly altered , the mate said , from the Lepardo of old . Morose and reserved he had always been ; but now misfortune had covered him with a skin - deep philosophy . But his eyes contracted and sparkled as of yore , whenever my name was mentioned ; and the mate knew what his intention was , in case he should find me a happy man . The simple mate was still more surprised at the alteration in my children ; as pretty a pair , he said , as ever he set eyes on . But they were kept most jealously from the notice of the crew , and even from their ancient friend 's attentions ; they were never allowed to be on the deck , except when the berths were being cleaned . They seemed to fear their reputed father , a great deal more than they loved him . Upon hearing this last particular I seized the mate by the hand , and felt something rise in my throat : I was so delighted to learn that the pirate had not succeeded in carrying nature by boarding . The next day I left Petro to see to the hardware business - to which we were bound by charter - while I set sail in the "
178848	179156	175102	175103	the fool	4251	" for the arms of my darling little ones . CHAPTER XVIII . They put me in the very hammock where that murderer of all my happiness had slept , and no wonder that I could find no rest there . Soon as I knew the reason , I was allowed to change , and crept into the little berth where my innocent pets had lain in each other 's arms . Here I slept much better than a king , for I even fancied that it smelt of Lily . If little Lily , as she shall be called , whatever the rogues have christened her , if my little beauty - for that I am sure she must be - ever comes to light , when I am in my grave , remember one thing , Clara , you will find her breath and general fragrance just as her mother 's were . Such things are hereditary , especially among women . After a long and stormy passage , and a fortnight spent in repairing at Bordeaux , we passed the familiar Essex marshes by night , and were off the Custom House by the last day of the year . When that tedious work was over - talk as we please of the douane , our own is as bad as most of them - feeling quite out of my latitude , and not a bit like an Englishman , I betook myself to a tavern near London Bridge . There everything seemed new , and I could not walk the streets without yawing into the wrong tide . But one old London custom held its ground with time . Papers a week and a fortnight old still strayed about in the coffee - room . Being told that the journals of that day were "
179160	179235	175102	175103	the fool	4251	" as they always are , I took up a weekly paper of some ten days back to yawn over it till supper time . It was too late for me to think of disturbing Peter Green by a sudden arrival , and so I had ordered a bed at this hotel . The weekly gazette in my hand was one of those which use the shears with diligence and method . Under the heading "
179239	179247	175102	175103	the fool	4251	" I found the following paragraph : - "
179523	179796	179520	179521	Gloucester Argus	651	" My dear brother 's distinguished degree was that of B.A. after a narrow escape from pluck . Clara , do n't look offended . Your father had very good abilities , but spent most of his Oxford time in pigeon matches at the Weirs , and expeditions to Bagley wood , which later in life he would have looked upon as felonious . This paltry puff would never have been reprinted by a London journal of eminence and influence , but for the suggestion at the end , which happened just to hit the sentiments of the more exalted editor . Now this weekly paper was sure to circulate among refugees from the continent , by reason of its well - known antipathy towards them ; and there happened to be in this very number a violent tirade against our Government for displaying what we delight to call the mighty Agis of England . I saw the danger at once , and my heart turned sick within me . My gay and harmless brother in the midst of his Christmas rejoicings , and a stealthy murderer creeping perhaps at that very moment towards him . But even if it were so , was there not some chance of Lepardo discovering his mistake , when in the neighbourhood where the Vaughans were so well known ? Yes , some chance there was , but very little . Bound upon such an errand he would not dare to show himself , or to make any inquiries , even if they seemed needful . And the mention by that cursed gossip of what he called "
179799	180758	179520	179521	Gloucester Argus	651	" - your father 's wedding tour - would banish all doubt of identity , had any been entertained . Even supposing that cold - blooded fiend should meet my poor brother , face to face , in the open daylight , it was not likely that he would be undeceived . Lepardo and I had met only once , and then in hot encounter . My brother was like me in figure , in face , and in voice ; and though I was somewhat taller and much darker of complexion , the former difference would not attract attention , unless we stood side by side ; the latter would of course be attributed to the effects of climate . From the gamekeeper 's evidence , I am now inclined to believe that Lepardo , while lurking in the lower coppice , among the holly bushes , must have cast his evil eyes on your poor father 's face , and convinced himself that he beheld his enemy . Flurried and frightened , I looked at the date of the paper . It was twelve days old . Possibly I might yet be in time , for most likely the murderer would set out on foot , according to Corsican practice , with the travel - stone bound on his knee . Even if he had travelled in modern fashion , he would probably lurk and lie in ambush about the house , enduring hunger and cold and privation , until his moment came . Could I leave for Gloucester that night ? No , the last train would have started , before I could get to Paddington . So I resolved to go by the morning express , which would take me to Gloucester by middle day . After a sleepless night , I was up betimes in the morning , and went through the form of breakfast while the cab was sent for . Presently a waiter came in with the morning papers , the papers of New Year's - day , 1843 . What I saw and what my feelings were , you , my poor child , can too well imagine . That day I could not bear to go . It was cowardly of me , and perhaps unmanly ; but I could not face your mother 's grief and the desolate household . Therefore I persuaded myself that I had discharged my duty , by visiting all the London police stations , and leaving the best description I could give of Lepardo . The following day I left London , and arrived , as perhaps you remember , long after dark , and during a heavy fall of snow . There at the very threshold I began amiss with you , for I outraged your childish pride by mistaking you for the housekeeper 's daughter . With a well - born child 's high self - esteem , and making no allowance for the dim light , you believed it to be a sham intended to mortify you ; and it poisoned your heart towards me . But you were wholly mistaken . My mind was full of your mother and of the terrible blow to her ; to you , whom I had never seen , and scarcely even heard of , I never gave a thought ; except the mistaken one that you were not old enough to be sensible of your loss . Little did I imagine what a fount of resolute will , and deep feeling , found a vent in the kicks and screams of the large - eyed minnikin , that would not be ordered away . You are entitled , Clara , to know all that I have done towards the discovery of your father 's assassin , and all that I can tell to aid your own pursuit . The hair found in your mother 's grasp was beyond a doubt Lepardo 's ; that laid upon your father 's bosom was , of course , my Lily 's . It was to show that her supposed seduction had been expiated . The one thing that most surprised me was that the murderer left no token , no symbol of himself . In a Vendetta murder they almost always do , as a mark of triumph and a gage to the victim 's family . Hence I believed that Signor Dezio was not killed in Vendetta , but by his nephew for gain . How Lepardo got into the house I have no idea , or rather I had none , until you told me of the secret passage , and Mrs. Daldy 's entrance . Till then I always thought that he had clambered up , as he did at Veduta tower . But unless there was a traitor in the household , he must have been there more than once , to have known so well your father 's sleeping room . It would have been waste of time for me to concern myself about the county police . That body of well - conducted navvies - Lepardo would have outwitted them , when he was five years old . Neither did I meddle with the coroner and his jury , but left them to their own devices and indigenous intellect . These displayed themselves in much puzzle - headed cross - questioning , sagacious looks , and nods , and winks of acute reservation . It was , as most often it is , a bulldog after a hare . Lepardo might safely have been in the midst of them , asked for a chair , and made suggestions . as "
180762	181184	179520	179521	Gloucester Argus	651	" But with the London police it was somewhat different . They showed some little acumen , but their fundamental error is this - they pride themselves on their intelligence . No man of any real depth ever does such a thing as this . He knows very well that whatever he is , there are half a million more so ; that the age of exceptional intellects expired , at least in this country , with Mr. Edmund Burke , and is not likely to rise from the dead . Now we are all pretty much good useful clods on a level : education , like all good husbandry , tends to pulverisation ; and if the collective produce is greater , let us be at once thankful and humble . The London police , being proud of their intelligence , declared that there could be no doubt about their catching the criminal . They laughed at my belief that he might walk through the midst of them , while they would touch their hats to him , and beg him to look after his handkerchief . At one time , I think , they were really on his track , and I went to London , and stayed there , and did my best to help them . But they were all too late ; Lepardo , if he it were , had left for Paris the week before . To Paris I followed , but found no trace of him there . Then I went on to Corsica , thinking it likely that he would return to his old piratical ways . Moreover , I wanted to see how my children 's estates were managed , and to revisit St. Katharine 's . All was calm and peaceful . Lily 's grave and her father 's were blended in one rich herbage . There all the bloom of my life was drooping , like the yellow mountain - rose , whence if a single flower be plucked , all the other blossoms fall . Count Gaffori received me kindly . His daughter was married and had two children , who played where Lily 's boy and girl should by rights be playing . I could not bear it , and came away , having nothing now to care for . Wherever I went the world seemed much of a muchness to me ; and to my own misfortunes the blood of my brother was added . I found the "
181186	181448	181449	181450	Jonathan Wild	654	" still under worthy Petro , and returned in her to England , and she still is mine . Petro would not come ; he was too true a Corsican to leave the beloved island now his hair was grey . So I set him up at Calvi with a vessel of his own , and now and then I receive a letter from good Marcantonia . They have promised to watch for the reappearance of our fearful enemy ; and Petro has sworn to shoot him , if ever he gets a chance . After my return to England , I set to work with all my energy to improve this property . In this , if in nothing else , I have thoroughly succeeded . Much opposition I had to encounter ; for the tenants regarded me as a mere interloper , and their hearts were with you and your mother . When I call them together to - morrow , as I intend to do , abandon all my right , title , and interest , and declare you their Signora , it is my firm belief that they will hardly think me worth cursing before they worship you . This old retainership is a thing to be proud and yet ashamed of . It is a folly that makes one glory in being a fool . Why , after you left for Devonshire much , as you know , against my will , I could not ride out without being insulted , and even the boys called me "
181452	182215	181449	181450	Jonathan Wild	654	" But this was due , in some measure , to your father 's gay geniality , and hearty good - will to all men , contrasted with my satiric and moody reserve . Neither were your youth , and sex , and helplessness , lost upon that chivalrous being - if he only knew his chivalry - the sturdy English yeoman . Why did I let you go ? Well , I believe it was one of the many mistakes of my life ; but I had a number of reasons , though personal dislike of you was not , as you thought , one of them . No , my child , I have never disliked you ; not even on the night when you came and denounced me , with the dagger in your hand . I must indeed have been worse than I am , if I could have nourished ill - will against a young thing , whom I had made an orphan . By some instinct , you knew from the first that the deed was mine , although I was not the doer . I would have loved you , if you would have let me , my heart yearned so over children . But of my reason for letting you go , the chiefest perhaps - setting aside that I could not stop you - was this consideration . For years I had longed , and craved in my heart of hearts , to tell your mother all , and obtain her gentle forgiveness . But any allusion - no matter how veiled and mantled - to the story of her loss threw her , as you know well , into a most peculiar state , wherein all the powers of mind and body seemed to be quite suspended . With a man 's usual roughness of prescription for the more delicate sex , I believed firmly that total change of living , and air , and place , and habits , would relax this wonderful closure , secure my forgiveness , and re - establish her health . The shock I received at her death was almost as terrible as when my brother died . When I stood beside you at her grave , I was come with the full intention of telling you all my story , and begging you to return with me , and live once more in your father 's house . But your behaviour to me was so cold and contemptuous , that I forgot my crushing debt to you ; and humiliation became , for the moment , impossible . I meant , however , to have written to you that evening , before you should leave the village ; but as you now are aware that very evening , I was smitten helpless . Partially recovering , after months of illness , I was deeply distressed to find that you had left your good friends in Devonshire , and were gone , my informants could not say whither . Neither had I learned your whereabouts up to the time of my last illness , when I was making inquiries , of which your enemy reaped the benefit . For the rest , you know that I never meant to rob you of your inheritance , though bigoted nonsense enables me . To - morrow , please God , I will put it out of my power to do so . Mrs. Daldy 's motive you have long since perceived . Failing my children , and the attainted Lepardo , her son is the heir to all the lands of the Della Croce . She has held me much in her power , by her knowledge of parts of my history . Henry 's baptismal entry , as well as that of my marriage , was in the packet she stole . One word more , my darling - and from an old man , who has wandered and suffered much , you will not think it impertinent . Leave your revenge to God . In His way - which we call wonderful , because the steps are unseen - He will accomplish it for you , as righteousness demands . Any interference of ours is a worm - cast in His avenue . Though I am stricken and dying , He , if so pleases Him , will bring me my children before I die , that I may bless Him , and tell my Lily . "
182689	182692	182688	182690	a " female	6027	" female , "
184539	184565	184532	184532	His	1276	" My dear , I have seen him once only , and that more than twenty years ago , and in an interview of some excitement "
184581	184915	184532	184532	His	1276	" but I will describe him to the best of my recollection . He is rather a tall man , at least of about my own height , but more lightly built than myself . His hands and feet are remarkably small and elegant . His face is of the true Italian type , a keen oval with a straight nose , and plenty of width between the eyes , which are large and very dark . His forehead is not massive , but well - formed , and much whiter than the rest of his face . The expression of his countenance is that of shrewdness and versatility , with a quickness eager to save both you and himself from the trouble of completing your sentence . But all this is common enough . One thing I saw , or fancied , which is not quite so common . As I dealt him that blow with my fist , my eyes for one flash met his , and his leaped towards one another , as if he had a strong cast in them . Before that , and afterwards too , there was no appearance of any distortion : if there were any at that moment , it arose from the start of terror or fury jerking the muscles awry . His voice is flexible and persuasive , and soft as a serpent - charmer 's . I think he must be a most arrogant man ; profoundly convinced of his own abilities , but seldom caring to vindicate them . Just the man to get on in the world , if he were only what is called respectable . Just the man to break a woman 's heart , and crush the spirit of a meek and humble child . Ah , I would forgive him his sins against me , though not his wrongs towards you , if I could only learn that he had been kind to my children . "

A deal of money there be in it , and no fear of Joe because he knows it , and there lives a man in Gloucestershire knows me well by the name of Thomas Henwood . Best look sharp I say . I be up to every one of you . John Huxtable his name , no mark this time . God save the queen . "
186728	187444	186724	186724	Sally	382	" Now what do you think , Miss Clara dear ? No you never would guess as long as you live - father are going to London town , and me , and Jack , and Beany Dawe . None of us have slept two grunts of a pig , ever since it were made up , only father , and he always sleep without turning . Now mind if I tell you all about it , you must not tell again , Miss Clara , because there is ever so much money upon it , and we do hear they have put it on some London paper and no business of theirs . Two great gentlefolks , the greatest of any about these parts , have been and made up a bet for my father to wrestle along with a great big chap as they calls the North Country champion . Seems as some great Northern lord was boasting in London one dinner - time , Speaker 's dinner they called it because there were a deaf and dumb dinner next day , this here great lord was telling up as how Sam Richardson were the strongest man in the world . So our Sir Arthur spake up for Devonshire , and laid him a quart - pot full of sovereigns as he would find a better man in the West country . And so I do n't know the rights of it , nor father nor mother either , but it was made up atwixt them that Farmer Huxtable , that 's my father , Miss , should try this great North country chap at the time of the great Xabition - you never showed me the way to spell it , Miss , so I go by the light of nature , as you used to say , Miss - and should take best of three falls for 200 l. a side . That will be 400 l. for us , when father gets it , and all his expenses paid , and they say the other folk wo n't allow no kicking , so he must be a soft - shelled chap ; but father feel no call to hurt him , if so be he can help it . Mother do n't want father to go , but he say he be bound for the honour of old Devonshire , or maybe they will take a man not good enough to make a standard . And please , Miss , when we brings home the money , I be to go to Miss Bowden 's , in Boutport Street , and our Jack to be put to a day - school not more than six miles away , and then I hope he know himself , and look higher than that minx of a Tabby Badcock . What do you think , Miss Clara , you would never believe it I know , but only a week ago last Tuesday I come sudden round the corner , and catched her a kissing of our Jack in the shed there by the shoot . And after all you taught her , Miss ! Jack he ran away , as red as mangawazzle , but that brazen slut , there she stand with her legs out , as innocent as a picture . Never a word I said , but with no more to do I put her head in the calves ' stommick as we makes the cheese with , in a bucket handy . It would have done you good to see her Miss , she did cry so hard , and she smell of it for a week , and it cure our Jack , up to Sunday anyhow . Mother come out at the noise , but her see that she deserve it , and the runnet was no account , except for the pigs , because it were gone by . I hope she know her manners now and her spear in life with her sheep 's eyes , and not come trying to catch any of my family . Well , Miss Clara please , father want mother to go ; but no , say she , "
187448	187455	187456	187456	them	4440	" - she ought to have said "
187457	187467	187470	187470	they	4440	" Miss , now had n't she ought ? - "
187496	187501	187502	187502	Clara	300	" - she call her "
187503	187509	187502	187502	Clara	300	" now , Miss , - "
187517	187540	187541	187541	I	0	" Then father rub the nose of him , you know the way he do it , Miss , and he say , "
187554	187568	187502	187502	Clara	300	" Mother look up very sharp at that , and say quite peart , "
187584	188094	188095	188095	I	0	" So I be to go Miss ; and go I would n't without Jack and leave him along of that sly cat Tabby , and her got sweet again now ; besides I want him to choose a knife I promised him , same as he saw to Coom one time , if he would n't let Tabby kiss him with seven blades and a corkscrew , and I 'll give eighteen pence for it , that I will . And Beany Dawe must go to show us the way about , and see as they does n't cheat us , because his father was once to London town , and told him a power about it . If you please , Miss Clara , father be put in training as they call it in these parts , all the same as a horse . He run up and down Breakneck hill , with the best bed on his back , nine times every day , and he do n't drink no cider , no nor beer , nor gin and water , and mother hardly know him , he be come so clear in the skin ; but he say his hand shake still from the time I taught him to write , and please , Miss , what do you think of the way he is going to sign this ? I ca n't get him to put his thumb right , no nor his middle finger , and he stick his elbow out every bit as bad as Tabby , and he say he like the pot - hooks over the fire best , but for all that I believe I shall make a scholard of him , particular when he give up wrestling , which he have sworn to do if he throw this Cumberland chap , and stick to his Bible and Prayer - book . Please , Miss , not to be offended , but excuse us asking if you like to see the great wrestling . Father say no , it would not be fitty , and that be the worst of being a gentlefolk ; but mother say what harm , and she be sure the farmer do it twice as well with you there , and you shall have the best seat in the place next to the two judges , and such a pretty handkerchief they sent down all spotted the same as a Guernsey cow , how the people in church did stare at me , and you shall have two of the best , Miss , but I am afraid it be making too bold ; but you never see any wrestling , Miss , and I am sure you would enjoy it so . It take place in the copandhagen fields , next Saturday week . Do come , Miss Clara dear , it will do you so much good , and you see father , and me , and Jack , and Beany Dawe . "

190180	190444	190445	190445	You	4509	" Her reply would fill a chapter , so I will not enter upon it , but go to bed and miss the sound of dear Judy 's tail at the door . In the first course of my dreams , Mr. Shelfer passed on his bedward road , having politely taken his shoes off at the bottom of the stairs ; in doing which he made at least three times the noise his shodden feet would have inflicted . In the morning I took my old walk round the Square , and then sat down and tried to be patient until the bailiffs should come . Of course I did not mean to go to my darling Isola , nor even to let her know that I was so near at hand , although my heart was burning to see her sweet face again . I even kept away from the window , though I wanted to watch for the bailiffs , and strictly ordered Mrs. Shelfer not to tell her , if she should call , a word about my being there . However , it was all in vain . Mr. Shelfer went out after breakfast to his play - work in the Square , and the smell of his pipe invaded my little room . I think he must have left the front door open ; at any rate I heard , all of a sudden , a quick patter of running feet , and such a crying and sobbing , and Mrs. Shelfer hurrying out to meet it . "

190541	190693	190537	190537	I	0	" And up flew Idols , in a perfect mess of tears . What could I do but fly to meet her , and hug my only pet ? What with her passion of grief , and sudden joy , at seeing me , she fainted away in my arms . I got her somehow to the sofa , and kissed her into her senses again . When she came to herself , and felt sure it was not a dream , she nestled into my bosom , as if I had been her husband , and stole long glances at me to see whether I was offended . Her pretty cloak lay on the floor , and her hat beneath the table . For a long time she sobbed and trembled so that she could not say a word , while I kept on whispering such vain words as these : "
190719	190784	190711	190711	Clara	300	" To see that sweet child 's misery , I felt in such a rage , I could have boxed her enemy 's ears . But I never thought that it was more than a child 's vexation . At last , after drinking a tumblerful of water , and giving room to her palpitating heart , she contrived to tell me her trouble . "

190953	190975	190978	190978	you	300	" She looked at me with quick pride flashing through her abasement , and she took her arm off my shoulder . "
191052	191123	191044	191044	he	0	" She fell away from me , her cheeks all crimson with shame , and her long eyelashes drooping heavily on them . I caught her to my heart : poor wronged one , was she a whit less pure ? I seemed to love her the better , for her great misfortune . Of course , I had guessed it long ago , from what her brother told me . "

I saw that it was the moment for learning all that she knew ; and the time for scruples was past . "

Oh , traitorous Clara , it was not the kiss - deeply as I loved her - but the evidence I wanted . I knew that with her ardent nature she would breathe her soul upon me . The exquisite fragrance of her breath was like the wind stealing over violets . I had noticed it often before . My last weak doubt was scattered ; yet I played with her and myself , one sweet moment longer . "

192732	193321	192729	192730	Lily Vaughan	603	" She drew her arms from me , and leaped up from the sofa ; she was so amazed and frightened . She looked at me most sadly , believing that I was mad ; then she fainted again , and fell back into my arms . When I had brought her round , and propped her up with a pillow - for cushions were very scarce - the strain of the mind being over , my brain began to whirl so that I could neither think nor act . For a long time I could not have enough of kissing and hugging Idols . I played with her hair , as if I had been her lover ; and then patted and caressed her , as if she had been my baby . And had I no thought of another , who ought to be doing all this to me ? Yes , I fear that it lay in the depth of my heart , stronger than maid 's love of maiden , or even than my delight at the joy coming to my Uncle . Then I hated myself for my selfishness , and caught up my Lily and rubbed her , and made her understand things . I flung a decanter of water over both her and myself , which saved us from hysterics . Poor little thing ! She was not like me . Strong Passion was a stranger to her , and she fell before his blow . I had fought with him so long , that I met him like a prize - fighter , and countered at every stroke . Up ran Mrs. Shelfer , in the height and crest of the wave , when backwards or forwards , crying or laughing , hung on a puff of wind . She came with a commonplace motive ; she thought we were playing at cricket with her beloved sticks . Her arrival made a diversion , though it had no other effect , for I walked the little thing out , and locked the door behind her . Then I got my darling new cousin into my arms , and kissed her , and marched her about the room , and made her show her Vaughan instep . Excuse the petty nonsense - what women are quite free from it ? - but for many generations our feet have been arched and pointed : of course it does not matter ; still I was glad that hers were of the true Vaughan pattern . Then , as she so hated all the stuffs they sell , I showered over her an entire bottle of the very best Eau de Cologne . It was a bit of bullying ; but all girls of high spirit are bullies . And it made her eyes water so dreadfully , that she cried as hard as I did . CHAPTER IV . It must be owned that my evidence at present was very shadowy . Yet to myself I seemed slow of hand for not having grasped it before . To the mind there was nothing conclusive , to the heart all was irresistible . I have not set down a quarter of the thoughts that now dawned upon me ; and it would be waste of time to recount them , when actual proof is forthcoming . And poor Idols gave me small chance of thinking clearly , in the turbulent flood of her questions . "
193396	193899	193391	193391	you	4579	" At length I knelt down , and thanked God - rather late in the day , I must own - for His wonderful guidance to me . While doing so , and remembering , as I always did then , my mother - revealed in sudden light I saw the justice of God 's Providence . Long as I had groped and groped , with red revenge my leading star , no breath of love or mercy cheering the abrupt steps of a fatalist , so long had He vouchsafed to send me check and warning , more than guidance . By loss of wealth and dearest friends , by blindness and desertion , and the crushing blow to maiden 's pride when her heart is flung back in her face , by sad hours of watching and weeping over the bed of sickness , by the history of another 's wrongs - worse than my own , and yet forgiven - by all these means , and perhaps no less by the growth of the mind , and wider views of life , the spirit , once so indomitable , had learned to bow to its Maker . Stooping thus it saw the path , which stiff - necked pride could not descry . Not first and sole , as it would have been two years since , but side by side with softer thoughts , came the strong belief that now God had revealed to me the man who slew my father . And what humiliation to all my boasted destiny ! I had grasped the hand that did the deed , smiled to the eyes that glared upon it , laughed at the sallies of the mind that shaped it . Enough of this ; ere it go too hard with Christian feeling . My bosom heaves , my throat swells , and my eyes flash as of old . Before I had time to resolve what next to do for Isola would not let me think , we had another interruption . That girl had a most ill - regulated and illogical mind . And the fault was fundamental . If the lovely senior sophist had ever got her degree , and worn the gown of a Maiden of Arts , it could only have come by favour , after the manner of kissing . Her enthymems were quick enough , and a great deal too quick I believe ; but as for their reduction or eduction into syllogisms - we might as well expect her to make a telescope out of her boot - tags . And now at once she expected , and would not give me room for a word , that I should minutely detail in two sentences , with marginal annotations , and footnotes , queries , conjectures , and various readings , all incorporated into the text , everything that had ever , anywhere , or by any means , befallen her "
193903	193949	193391	193391	you	4579	" Not being Thucydidean enough to omit the key - word in the sentence , and mash ten thoughts into one verb , I could not meet the emergency ; and my dear cousin lost her patience , which was always a very small parcel . "
193975	193976	193969	193969	I	0	" "
193982	194002	194008	194008	you	300	" I said - why be mawkish in Oscan - English , when Saxon is to be had ? - "
194052	194132	194138	194138	Clara	300	" The sneer was most unjust , and dreadfully unkind , but far too natural for me , so long pent in , to resist it . I saw that I had grieved my pet , so I begged her pardon , and reviled myself , till all was right again . Then suddenly she leaped up and cried , with her hand upon her bounding heart - every look and gesture must have been like her mother 's . "
194190	194250	194251	194251	Idols	483	" She wrenched at the door - handle in her hurry , forgetting that I had locked it ; rich colour leaped into her cheeks , and her features and form seemed to dance , like a flickering flame , with excitement . No wonder her mother had loved , and been loved , with such power of passion . "
194327	194384	194320	194320	he	1276	" Poor little thing , how her face fell , and how the roses faded out of it ! That look of hers went to my heart ; but I knew what the mother had died of , and feared lest her image and picture should perish in the same manner . So I said again : "
194401	194402	194386	194386	you	300	" "
194428	194568	194570	194570	your	4599	" At this moment , two heavy knocks , like a postman 's , but not so quick , sounded through the house . I knew what they meant , one was Balaam , the other was Balak . Isola clung to me , and turned pale ; she thought it was some one pursuing her . I told her hastily whom I expected , and sent her to Mrs. Shelfer 's room . My heart beat high , when with many a scrape and bow , the worthy but not ornamental pair sidled heavily into the room . To my greetings they answered me never a word ; but Balaam stood solemnly at the end of the little table , and beckoned to his partner to fasten the door . This being done with some pantomime , which meant "
194579	194609	194570	194570	your	4599	" the two men , who looked none the leaner for their arduous exertions , stood side by side before me . Tired of this nonsense I exclaimed impatiently , "
194625	194643	194620	194620	you	4599	" Balaam winked at Balak , and receiving a ponderous nod , began to digest it leisurely . "
194678	194716	194717	194717	Balak	557	" Balaam 's tongue revolved in his mouth , but burst not the bonds of speech , and he tried to look straight at both windows , - till my hand was on the bell - pull . "

194818	194835	194840	194840	I	0	" Here a long interchange of signals took place , and even whispering behind a hat . "

194906	194928	194931	194931	you	4602	" He looked rather taken aback , but could not well get out of it . Balak smiled grimly at him . "

195009	195010	195011	195011	You	4602	" "
195020	195268	195269	195269	Professor	4614	" What they told me at wearisome length , and with puzzling divergence , and quantities of self - praise , need not occupy many lines . They had traced the Jelly - corses , as they called Della Croce , from Somers Town to Lisson Grove , where they stayed but a very short time , Lepardo Della Croce , under some fictitious name , giving lessons in French , Spanish , and Italian , at schools in Portland Town and St. John 's Wood . But he only seemed to play with his work , though he never broke any engagement to which he really pledged himself . He was always reserved and silent , accepted no invitations , and gathered his real subsistence by night at chess - clubs and billiard - rooms , where his skill was unequalled . His only friends were Italian refugees , his only diversion the vivisection of animals . It must have been about this time that he saw the newspaper paragraph , and did what he did to me . Then he changed his name again , and lived awhile in Kensington ; he had been in London years before , and seemed to know it well . Here a nobleman , whom he had taught some new device at billiards , took him up and introduced him to a higher class of pupils , and obtained him some back - door palace appointment . He dubbed himself "
195271	196287	195269	195269	Professor	4614	" and started as Dr. Ross . But still he missed the excitement and change of his once adventurous life , and several times he broke loose , and left his household , for weeks and months together . Then the two lovely children , whom all admired but none were allowed to notice , were attended wherever they went , by a dark - browed Italian woman . Suddenly they all left Kensington , and went to live at Ball 's Pond ; the reason being some threatened exposure of the Professor 's cat - skinning propensities . His love of vivisection had become the master - passion , and he would gratify it at all hazards . There is to some natures a strange fascination in the horrible cruelties perpetrated under the name of science . Through its influence he even relaxed his strict reserve a little , and formed the acquaintance of a gentleman connected with the college at Camden Town ; to which suburb after a while he removed , because he found it impossible to pursue his inhuman researches under his own roof comfortably . Here , by means of his new ally , who could not help admiring his infinitely superior skill , he was appointed lecturer at several schools for young ladies , where smatterings of science were dealt in . And now he was highly respected by people who did not know him , and idolised by young ladies too clever to care for pet parsons . Of course he became conceited ; for his nature was but a shallow one , and his cunning , though sharp and poisonous , had no solid barb at the end . So he sneered , and grimaced , and sniggered , and before an ignorant audience made learned men stammer and stutter , amazed at his bold assumptions , and too honest and large of mind to suspect them , at short notice . But the skill of his hands was genuine , and his power of sight most wonderful . I have since been told - though I do not believe it possible - that he once withdrew and bottled nearly half the lungs of a dog , tubercular after distemper , while the poor sufferer still gasped on , and tried to lick his face . Oh that I were a man ! How can I hear such things and not swear ? All animals , except one , hated him by instinct . The only one , not sagacious enough to know him , was his fellow - man . Men , or at any rate women , thought him a handsome , lively , playful , and brilliant being . And yet , upon the honour of a lady I declare - let those who know nothing of honour despise it as an after - thought - that when he first entered my room , in his graceful and elegant way , there ran through me such a shudder as first turns the leaves towards autumn , such a chill of the spinal marrow as makes the aura of epilepsy . Darling Judy hated him from every bristle of his body , not only through instinct , but for certain excellent reasons . The monster 's most intimate friend was a gallant Polish patriot , who had sacrificed all for his country , and lived here in dignified poverty . This gentleman and his wife could only afford one luxury ; and that , by denying themselves many a little comfort . They had the finest dog in London , one who had saved his master 's life from the squat - nosed sons of the Czar . This glorious fellow , of Maltese family , was the father of my Giudice - whom in his puppy days the Polish exile gave to Conrad and pretty girl Isola . Slowski , now an ancient dog , had a wen behind his shoulder , which grew and grew until the Professor could scarcely keep his hands from it . But he knew that any operation , in so severe a case , was nearly sure to kill a dog so old and weather - beaten . The owner too knew this , and would not have it meddled with . Lepardo Della Croce swore at last that he would taste no food until he had traced the roots of that wen . Judy , then a pretty pup , gambolled into the room and saw his poor papa - but I will not describe what a dog can not even bear to think of . Poor Slowski died that night , and the Pole knocked down the surviving brute , who shot him next day upon Hampstead Heath . However , the gentleman slowly recovered ; but during his illness the frenzied wife overstepped the bounds of honour - according to their ideas ; she took advantage of Cora , in the absence of Lepardo , and learned some of his previous crimes , by practising on the poor woman 's superstition . Then she found , through the firm of Green , Vowler , and Green , that my Uncle was still alive , traced out the history of the atrocious deed , and wrote the letter which had brought me to London . Soon afterwards , when her husband recovered , she was sorry for what she had done , and opened her lips on the subject no more ; at least in this country , which they soon forsook for America . In this brief epitome , I have told , for the purpose of saving trouble , a great deal more than I learned at the time , a great deal more than Balaam and Balak would have found out in a twelvemonth . But it makes no difference : for my conclusions and actions were just the same as they would have been , if I had known all the above . "
196294	196301	196290	196290	you	4615	" - was Balaam 's peroration - "

196495	196600	196487	196493	a gentleman who can not see you	4626	" Balaam and Balak looked very blank , and declared it would take them a week to write out half they had told me . This objection I soon removed , by offering to make an abstract of it , which I could do from memory , and then let them read and sign it . By this time they were both afflicted with thirst , which I sent them away to quench , while I drew up a rough deposition . But first I called darling Idols , and told her that now I had evidence which would satisfy even a sceptical father . "
196623	196624	196607	196607	you	5379	" "
196684	197121	197122	197122	You	4629	" The charm was a piece of chalcedony , ground into some resemblance which I could not recognise then , and very highly polished . She said it had been her brother Conrad 's , and he had given it to her ; hearing which I ceased to examine it . Presently the bailiffs returned , in very high spirits indeed , and ready to sign almost anything . But I took good care to inform them that , however hard they had laboured , I had made the discovery before them ; which they said was permiscuous , and not to be thought nothing of . All the forms being quickly despatched , I found a few minutes to think what was next to be done . It is too late in my journey for dalliance and embarrassment with the heavy luggage of motives , and the bandboxes of reflections , when we are past the last station , and flying to our terminus : enough that I resolved to take poor little Isola home at once to the house at Vaughan St. Mary , and the arms of her longing father , that he might see her before he died . I hoped he might live for years , but I feared he might die to - morrow ; so hangs over every one 's mind that fatal third stroke of paralysis . Her own entreaties and coaxing told much upon my resolution ; if none could resist her when happy , who could withstand her distress ? So Balaam and Balak were ordered most strictly to watch that demon 's abode , and at any risk give him in charge if he made attempt at departure . To ensure due vigilance , I reclaimed the 90 l. cheque , and gave one payable three days afterwards . They grumbled and did not like it ; but in the course of all my rough usage , I had learned one great maxim - Never trust , beyond the length of a cork , any man who is slave to the bottle . CHAPTER V. Eager as Isola was to see her true father at last , she pressed me strongly to call at her brother 's lodgings on our way to Paddington , and take him with us if possible ; or at any rate learn where he was , and how long he would be absent . But I refused to do anything of the kind . Though not half so proud as of old , I could not quite stoop to that . "
197127	197131	197122	197122	You	4629	" she continued , "

197505	197912	197496	197496	he	439	" We got to Paddington just in time to catch the two o'clock train , having telegraphed first to my Uncle that I was coming to take his advice , before doing anything more . This was true , so far as it went , and as much of the truth as I then dared to administer . This message was sent , not for the sake of finding the carriage at Gloucester , but in order to break the suddenness of our arrival . Through all my joy I dreaded what was to come , and knew not how to manage it . Idols talked fast enough all the way down the line . As yet she had seen scarcely anything of our quiet , rich English scenery ; and although the Great Western exhibits it rather flatly , some parts there are , below Swindon , which fill the mind with content . But our minds could not be so filled , being full of excitement already . Near Stroud poor Idols was in the greatest ecstasy , and expected me to know the owner of every pretty meadow . But after we entered my Uncle 's carriage - or mine , I suppose , it should now be called - dear Isola fell away into the deepest silence . She stored her wonder inwardly , nor showed the sweet depths of her eyes , until she sprang out at the foot of the old stone steps , trodden by so many hundreds of her ancestors . Then she looked up at the long gray house , with the dusk of July around it , and bats of three varieties flitting about the gables ; and I saw beneath her dark eye - lashes the tremulous light of a tear . After leading my sweet new cousin - whom everybody stared at , and who feared to look at the pavement - to my own snug quarters , I left her there under kind Mrs. Fletcher 's charge , and ran to my Uncle 's favourite room . Already my breath was short , and my heart up and down with excitement , and I had but the presence of mind to know that I was sure to make a mistake of it . I saw a great change in him , even since the Monday ; but he was the first to speak . "

198136	198192	198129	198129	Uncle	4650	" And I threw myself into his arms : his head fell heavily on my shoulder , and I felt that I had been too sudden . He could not speak , but fetched one long sob . I parted his white hair , and looked at him as if in surprise at his hastiness . "

198345	198402	198339	198339	you	3278	" He stood up as if to seize me , for I had withdrawn from his grasp , but his poor legs would not carry him ; so I was obliged to seize him instead . He fell sideways on a chair , and vainly tried to speak ; but his eyes never faltered from mine . "
198438	198439	198440	198440	I	0	" "

198508	198557	198495	198495	you	4656	" My object was to divert his mind , for I saw the approach of coma , and now trembled more than he did . With a feeble smile at the folly of my question , after such a love as his , he answered in great exhaustion , "
198575	199209	198565	198565	You	4656	" Here his chin fell on his breast , and he could not lift the key , but his eyes still shone with intelligence , and followed me everywhere . Ribbon and all I took the key , and rang the bell for Jane , the most careful and kind of nurses . I ordered her , in a whisper , to give my Uncle a glass of very strong brandy and water , if she could get him to swallow it ; and away I ran upstairs , hoping to relieve him . Then suddenly it struck me that I had no right to open that box , without the presence of a competent witness . I knew at once what box it was , from the constant anxiety my poor Uncle had shown about it . Who had such right to be my witness as his darling daughter ? So back I flew to my own rooms , and dragged the bewildered Isola down the broad corridor . The poor little thing was frightened so that she could hardly breathe . I had no especial object in opening that old box , at that particular moment , much as I had often longed to know what its contents were . My presence of mind was lost , and all I could think of was , that I might find something there to break that awful suspension of life , so likely to end in death . The box was in a panelled closet by the head of my Uncle 's bed . When I handed Idols the light to hold , she took it as if in a dream ; her cheeks were as white and transparent as the wax , and she held the candle so that a hot flake splashed on my neck . The lock of the long box turned most easily , and the hinges moved without creaking : most likely it had been pored over every day , for many years . The lid was arched and hollow , with straps of faded web inside it . In beautiful order , so fair that I hardly dared to touch them , lay the clothes and trinkets , the letters and little relics , the gloves and pocket - handkerchiefs , the fairy slippers , the wedding - dress , the coquettish veil , and saucy hat of the dead . I am not over sensitive , thank God , or I should not be living now ; but the sight of those things upset me more than any distress of my own . The small parcels of silver paper , screwed at the end and pinned in the middle , the pins put stupidly as men always put them , the light gay dresses made for some sweet figure , folded with such care , and yet quite out of the plaits , and labelled with the dates when last the dear one wore them , even a withered fern - wreath and a sprig of shrivelled myrtle - I could not thrust my commonplace hands into these holy treasures ; if I could I should never deserve to be myself so remembered . But one thing struck me , as thoughts profane always strike us crookedly ; if the poor lady could have been wept to life again , how much better would she have found all her things arranged , than she had ever kept them ! That is to say if she resembled her wondering and crying daughter , who knelt down and wanted to kiss every article in the box . Her little white hands were as busy as mice among them ; and long - drawn sobs were tumbled with interjections . "
199230	199260	199223	199224	Your father	5351	" Would he though ? - said I to myself - not if he knew whose hand it was that did it . She paid no attention to me . "
199287	199315	199223	199224	Your father	5351	" To my surprise she began to suck the stone , which her mother perhaps had sucked , eighteen years ago . Inside the paper was written , "
199355	199356	199359	199359	you	483	" "
199369	199410	199411	199411	Isola	440	" And with that I gave her a little push . In her heedless way , she fell almost into the box , and her light form lay amongst her mother 's dresses . A sudden thought flashed across me . "
199420	199421	199411	199411	Isola	440	" "
199439	199440	199429	199429	you	483	" "
199467	199966	199967	199967	Clara	300	" In a moment or two , I had all her beauty gleaming in white before me ; and carefully taking from the box a frock of pale blue silk , I lifted it over her head , and drew her dimpled arms through the sleeves ; then I fixed it in front with the turquoise buttons , and buckled the slender zone . Her blue eyes looked on in amazement , like violets at a snow - storm . Then I led her to the mirror , and proud as we both had always been of her beauty , the same thought struck us now . I saw it in the mirror , by the toss of her pointed chin and the coy bend of her neck : she saw it there as clearly , by the flash of my tear - bright eyes . Neither of us had ever seen that loveliest of all girls look half so lovely before . The glow of pride and beauty 's glory mantled in her cheeks ; and her eyes were softly beaming down the avenue of lashes , from clearest depths of azure . I never saw such eyes as she had , among all our English beauties . Some perhaps are as fine of colour , and as liquid , though not so lustrous : but the exquisite arch of the upper lid , and the rich short fringe of the lower , cast a tremulous light and shade , which dull Anglo - Saxons feel not . Like moonbeams playing through a mantled bridge . The dress fitted her exactly . It had been made for a slender , buoyant figure , as graceful and pure as a snow - wreath , yet full of warm motion and richness . Indeed , I must confess , that , although correct enough for the time and clime of the owner , it showed too much of the lifting snow for our conceptions of maidenhood : so I drew a gauzy scarf - perhaps a true fazoletto - over the velvet slope of the shoulders , and imprisoned it in the valley . This being nicely arranged , I hung her chalcedony charm from her neck , and fastened it to her waist - band . Then I caught up her clustering hair , nearly as thick and long as my own , after the Corsican fashion , snooded it close in ripples with a pink and white - striped mandile , and told her to love herself in the glass , while I ran off to the hot - house for a truss of Stephanotis . This , with a glossy sprig of Gardenia leaves to back it , I fastened cleverly into the clear mandile , on the curve of her elegant head , and my darling was complete . Then I kissed her sweet lips , and admired her , more than she admired herself . "

200069	200250	200251	200252	Uncle dear	7129	" I led her through the gallery and to the door of her father 's room , before she had time to think . She did not know but what I was taking her back to my own rooms , along another passage . At the sick man 's door I left her , while I went in to see how much might be safely ventured . My Uncle was leaning back in his deep reclining chair , with his weak eyes fixed most eagerly on the door . In vain he strove to hide his disappointment , and to look at me with gratitude . The wandering mind too plainly hoped for something dearer than a brother 's child . Dismissing Jane through the other room , that she might not encounter Isola , I sat down to examine him . The brandy and water had rallied his vital power , but made him hot and feverish . He kissed my hand to atone for some sharp and impatient expressions , and I saw that the moment was favourable . "

200628	200679	200624	200624	Idols	483	" It was all in vain ; I might as well have spared my devices . From the moment she crossed the threshold , his eyes had been leaping towards her . The paralysed man bounded forward , as if with galvanic life . His daughter met him as wildly . "
200686	200693	200620	200620	Uncle	1291	" was all he could sob , "
200702	201263	201264	201264	Isola	440	" With a father 's strength he clasped her , and her dark locks were showered with silver . As for tears - but I left them together when I had seen both safe on the sofa . CHAPTER VI . To our surprise and delight , the genuine Papa , instead of being worse the next day , looked more like himself than he had done at any time since the fever . But in spite of added importance , and the sense of parental dignity , he sat hand in hand with his beautiful daughter by the hour together , playing with her cheeks and hair , as little girls do with dollies . And all the time he was talking to her about her darling mother , and made her answer him in Italian , and made her kiss him every other minute ; and found out a thousand times , as a novelty every time , that she was the very image and model of her mother , and yet he was not sure that her smile was quite so sweet ; then to make up for depreciation he needs must kiss her again , and say , yes , he thought it was , though it was quite impossible for any other to be so - and thus they went on , till I thought there never would be an end of it ; albeit I did my utmost to keep away from them both . Knowing that I was in their way , and feeling rather out of spirits , I went my old accustomed round of places , sacred in my memory to a certain father and mother of my own . How long I wept at their simple graves , how I knelt to their God and mine , thanking Him from my desolate heart for the light now shed upon me , and how I prayed that they might both be looking down on me now and craving heavenly guidance for me through the peril yet to come - these , and the rest of my doings there , can not well be told except to the ears of orphans . The clouds of an overcast existence seemed to be opening rapidly , and though they could never disclose my sun and moon again , some happiness it was to know even how those had set . And more than all , the foul aspersion upon my father 's memory , which all the while I scorned it so , had lain heavily on my thoughts , this was now proved liar 's spittle , and my sweet darling father had offended not even a villain . A thousand times I implored his pardon for the splash having ever descended upon the hem of my garment , though shaken off straight - way with loathing . In the midst of my dreamy thoughts , and while I sat between the two low headstones , upon the very spot where I hope my own head may lie , the tremulous beauty of the Golden Thuja , which I had planted there , was pushed aside too carelessly , and something far more beautiful planted itself in front . It was my cousin Lily . I have been strictly forbidden ever to call her "
201266	201269	201270	201270	Idols	4682	" or even "
201272	201319	201270	201270	Idols	4682	" again , as savouring of the evil one . Lily Vaughan was beaming with young delight and happiness : the fresh west country air , sweet from the tropic gulf - stream , had crowned the April of her cheeks with a June of roses . "

201383	201451	201376	201376	you	491	" She glanced at the headstones engraved with initials and dates , and at once understood it all . For a long time she was silent , a long time I mean for her ; and her soft eyes glistened at once with awe and pity . At last , she crept close to me , looked at the ground , and whispered with a deep sigh : "
201460	201461	201453	201453	you	491	" "
201471	201472	201453	201453	you	491	" "

201715	201818	201706	201706	you	3499	" And at the tender memory , came tears , the voice of silence . Lily said not a word , but gathered and plaited a wreath of flowers , wherewith , as in a nuptial tie , she bound the white headstones together - anything so as not to disturb me just then . Even that trifle , a graceful idea born of her Southern origin , even that for the moment touched me deeply . Times there are when our souls seem to have taken hot baths in the springs of memory , and every pore of them is open . "
201957	201968	201949	201949	me	0	" The innocent creature kissed me , and promised solemnly . "

Then I told him all the story of Conrad and the accident , how he saved my mother 's life and mine , with the courage and skill of a true - born mountaineer . My Uncle was moved to tears , not only at the gallantry of his son , but also by the joy of discovering that all the obligations lay not upon one side . I also wept at finding that Lily had never heard of it . Conrad 's lofty nature scorned to narrate its own achievements . When , after that adventure , he discovered who we were , he avoided us because he believed that his father had slain mine . It was not till a later date , when he became of age - as the Corsicans reckon manhood - that Lepardo Della Croce told him all he knew of his history , dwelt on the foul shame wrought to the Della Croce by his bigamist father , and tried in vain to force on him the awful oath of Vendetta . The youth had too much English blood in his heart to accept the black inheritance . Thenceforth he could not bear the sight of the man who had killed , as they both supposed , his father , although , in his wrath for his mother 's wrongs and his own , he would not resent the deed . What marvel then that he spurned me , and was maddened with himself , at finding that he , the illegitimate , was in love with me , his legitimate sister ? But now , we are only half - cousins , and nature has never misled us . i.e. the age of twenty . All that evening , my Uncle was in the most glorious spirits , and I am not sure that Lily and I were very far behind him . He played us all sorts of boyish tricks , and we made reprisals with girlish ones , till Lily 's joyous laughter rang halfway clown the corridor . I had dressed her with especial care , and she did look such a love ! But it was all too sudden , and far too sweet to last . My Uncle indeed seemed quite beside himself , more gladsome than nature allows us to be with impunity . Then the vein dried all of a sudden , and the mind flowed the opposite way . He made his beautiful daughter , who , though not much of a sophist , had a soul that thrilled to music , he made her play the soft Corsican airs , that seem to weep as they breathe , and which she had learned from old Cora . He knew them all ; how well he knew them , his face turned from the light betrayed . The depth of melodious sadness , the touch of some nervine chord , which knew not its own existence , and starts to be known and appreciated , as might an unconscious poet , and more than all the trembling spread of the feelers of the heart , these are the proofs of nature 's presence in music or in poetry . Then he begged me to play some of the sweet and simple melodies of Wales . These he declared , and I had already perceived it , these were born of the self - same spirit , though not so highly intensified , as the Corsican romances . Finally , he told us many a moving tale of his Lily ; tales a man is loth to tell to those with whom he expects to live . How she was loved , and how she seemed to love everybody , and pretty answers she made to those who praised her beauty , and more than words or kisses , the loving things she did , the elegance of self - denial , and the innocence of merit . That night , that memorable night , we stayed up more than two hours over his proper time for going to bed . He seemed so sad to part , that I could not bear to hurry him . One thing he told me which I was glad to hear . "
205719	205735	205709	205709	she	569	" I was rather surprised ; but answered him warmly , and in all truth : "
205761	205779	205754	205759	the few whom I really love	4836	" Then , as I was to start at six o'clock in the morning , he wished me "
205783	205840	205754	205759	the few whom I really love	4836	" in a solemn manner , which seemed to me quite uncalled for . He drew my young face to his own , so marked by sorrow and illness , looked into my eyes as if I were to remember something , then held me in his trembling embrace , and kissed me long and fondly . "
205859	205860	205861	205861	Mine	0	" "
205877	206155	205870	205870	I	0	" His daughter took him away , with her white arms thrown around him . For now she slept in the closet next to his room , where I had so long been quartered . CHAPTER VII . In the early morning , I was off for London , taking Mrs. Fletcher with me , much against my will , because she seemed to cumber me both in thought and action . Between the door and the avenue , I looked from the open carriage - I hate to be shut up in summer - at the dear old house . Lily had got up to breakfast with me , in spite of my prohibition ; and she was going with us as far as the lodge , to have a nice walk back . To my great surprise I saw my poor Uncle , standing at his open window , wrapped in a dressing - gown . He kissed his hand and waved me his last farewell . I leaped on the seat to reply , and then scolded him with my glove . Half in play and half in sorrow , he mocked my lively gestures , and the morning breeze lifted his silver hair , as he wafted me the last kiss . I told Lily to scold him well , with my very best love , and she asked me in the most ladylike manner , if I saw any green in her eye . The girl had picked up a great deal of slang among the fair collegians . Mrs. Fletcher looked sadly shocked ; so I said , to reassure her : "
206174	206175	206159	206160	Mrs. Fletcher	534	" "
206189	206207	206208	206208	John	305	" she replied with her most sagacious air : and at Gloucester she whispered to the coachman , "
206245	206246	206229	206229	she	677	" "
206254	206463	206229	206229	she	677	" answered John , with a grin . Nevertheless , it found its way over the house , and the result was that all the girls came to Lily about their sweethearts . I mention this trifling incident only to show how little I thought that I then saw the last of my Uncle . At Paddington we met Annie Franks taking her ticket for Gloucester , and looking most bright and blooming , with a grand pocket in her cloak , made to hold a three - volumed novel . I had only time for a few words with her , in which I commended my Uncle to her especial attention , as she had ten times my cousin 's experience . Then I went with her to the down - platform , and saw her get into the carriage , and gave her the last of my sandwiches , while a cruel guard made her turn out her new pocket , insisting that she must have a little dog concealed there . I laughed at the poor little dear , as crimson with mortification she showed before all the gentlemen the triple fluted bulk , and the guard read out , more in amazement than rudeness , "
206484	206515	206480	206482	the Paynim Lady	4848	" The gentlemen were gentlemen , and tried very hard not to smile ; but the way the guard scratched his head was a great deal too much for them . "
206522	206594	206480	206482	the Paynim Lady	4848	" cried he , trying to escape with a joke . I drew her out of the carriage , with tears in her soft gray eyes , and put her into another , where Sir Ingomar was unknown , and might spur on at pleasure . Then the smiles returned to her shy and innocent face , and she put her head to the window , and whispered gently to me : "
206601	206602	206599	206599	dear	5768	" "
206632	206647	206652	206652	her	569	" Annie 's conception of perfect bliss was to sit upon a shady bank , "
206656	206959	206652	206652	her	569	" with a cabbage - leaf full of strawberries by her , and a cut - and - thrust novel upon her lap . Off she went with a lovely smile , foreseeing all these delights . From Paddington we drove straightway to the lodgings of Conrad Vaughan . As we jolted along the New - road , which always has more holes in it than any other street in London , I lost my wits in a tumult of thick tempestuous thought . What would Conny say to see me , me the haughty Clara , coming all impatiently even in quest of him ? Would it not have been far better , far more like an English maiden , to wait , and wait , and wear the soul out , rather than to run the risk of mis - interpretation ? True , it was for his father 's sake , to save him from deadly peril , and to make his happiness complete ; but might not all have been done by messenger , as well as by me in person ? So at least might fancy those who did not know our enemy . Worst of all , and cloudiest thought , that filled the eyes every time it came , - would he love me still ? Would not the strong revulsion , that must have torn him in two , when he dashed his hand on his forehead , and forgot even man 's forbearance , would not , must not this have snapped all the delicate roots of love ? I could not tell . Of man 's heart I know nothing ; but I felt that with me , a woman , such a horrible thing would create only longing to make amends . "
206968	206969	206960	206961	Mrs. Fletcher	534	" "
206975	206991	206652	206652	her	569	" - she always called me so from habit when no one else was present - "
207020	207021	207017	207018	Miss Clara	300	" "
207051	207052	207048	207048	you	4851	" "
207158	207159	207160	207161	Mrs. Fletcher	534	" "
207204	207205	207190	207190	I	0	" "
207216	207217	207213	207213	Miss.	461	" "
207241	207348	207233	207233	I	0	" However , it did not matter ; for there was no one there to see me . Conrad was gone to Paris ; he had quitted London quite suddenly , and there was a letter left for his sister , which the girl forgot to post , till she thought it was too late . And he said very likely he should go on to Italy ; and they were not to keep the rooms , if they had a chance of letting them , only to put away the things he had left , in the cupboard . So I took the letter , directed "
207353	207478	207349	207351	Miss Isola Ross	440	" but I did not dare to open it , much as I longed to do so . Having enclosed it in a new envelope , and posted it in the nearest letter - box , with a heavy heart I re - entered the cab , and went on to Mrs. Shelfer 's . Mrs. Shelfer was of course surprised to see me so soon again . Nevertheless she was all kindness and hospitality , as usual . The residue of her little debt had been long ago released , and now I paid full rent , for I could easily afford it . In answer to my eager inquiries as to what had occurred since Wednesday , the little woman said shortly : "
207506	207507	207494	207494	Charley	409	" "
207526	207527	207517	207517	I	0	" "
207573	207574	207560	207560	They	4862	" "
207581	207582	207583	207583	They	4862	" "
207877	207987	207872	207872	he	4879	" ' Ma'am , us be here now in this Lunnon town , And it bain't likely as we be going down , Till us see every mortal thing as there be for to see , And take all the change out in a thorough - going spree . ' Then the big man laugh and clap him on the back ; and the little one wink both his eyes , and look to see what I think of it . Then when he see me laugh , he make me such a coorous bow , that what with his - what do they call the plaister , Miss ? "
207988	207998	207872	207872	he	4879	" Diachylon , perhaps you mean , Mrs. Shelfer ? "
207999	208076	207872	207872	he	4879	" Ah , that 's the word . What with his strange diaculum , and his dancing altitude , I declare I was a most a going to invite them in : but I recollects , no , no : If Charley gets along of such Reginalds as these , I may stand at the bed - room door and whistle for a week . There 's nothing Charley loves so much as a downright Reginald . "
208132	208147	208111	208111	she	4882	" Well , Mrs. Shelfer , I want to hear the end of it . "
208148	208471	208472	208472	Mister	4884	" Just what I say , Miss. Yes , yes , no time to spare , and the pudding boiling . So I says , quite sharp , ' What name , my good sir , and will you leave a message ? Miss Vaughan is out of town . ' ' Wull , ' says he , just as I tell you , Miss , ' ony plase you say , ma'am , as Jan Uxtable , and Beany Dawe , and the two beggest of the chillers has doed theirselves the honour of coming to lave their dooty . ' Then the little girl look up and she flash her ribbons and say , ' Mr. Huxtable , if you please , ma'am , and Mr. Ebenezer Dawe , and Miss Huxtable , and Master John , has called . ' ' Had n't you better write it down , Miss ? ' says I , as innocent as possible . ' Do you suppose I ca n't then ? ' says she , with such a spitting out of her eyes , and she swinging a new parry sole . ' Just give me a sheet of papper , if you keep such a thing in the house . ' ' Plase to excuse the little wanch , ma'am , ' says the big man , quite humble , ' us ca n't hardly make head nor tail of her , since her come to this here Lunnon . If I had only knowed it I 'd have had her mother along of me , that I would ees fai , and the coo be her own midwaife . But ony plase you say Jan Uxtable come if they count it dacent hereaway . Threescore acres and five , ma'am , without reckon the Cleeve , and no man have a call , to my mind , to christen himself "
208473	208771	208111	208111	she	4882	" on less than a hundred acres , in Lunnon or out of it . ' ' Very well , sir , ' I says , for I took to the big man somehow , ' I will deliver your message . Miss Vaughan only went from here of middle day on Wednesday . ' ' And tell her please , if she do come back , ' says spirity Miss Parrysole , with the tears in her great blue eyes , ' that Sally Huxtable leave her very best love and duty , and hope so much Miss Clara will come to see the great wrestling to - morrow , twelve o'clock , and be early . And they be betting now two to one on the other man , ma'am . But he have no chance , no more than Tim Badcock with father . ' ' I be much afeared , ma'am , ' says the deep - voiced man , as soft as any bell , ' I be afeared our Sally will be begger by a lanyard nor ever her daddy or her mammy was . But likely it be all for the best . ' And with that all four of them crooked their legs to me most polite , and went on round the corner ; and after them went a score of boys , that seemed to follow them everywhere . The boys knew all about it , and so did I at last , that it was the great champion wrestling , that is to be to - morrow . Charley have been mad about it going on now two months . And can you please to tell him , Miss , which way to lay his money ? "
208772	208828	208111	208111	she	4882	" To be sure , I can . Let him take every offer of two to one against the Devonshire champion ; and if he loses I will make it good to him , upon condition that he gives you everything he wins . Now please to let me have a cup of strong tea . "
209299	209305	209306	209306	she	534	" Well , Miss Clara , "
209323	209324	209306	209306	she	534	" "
209341	209342	209335	209335	you	0	" "
209439	209845	209429	209429	Gloucester	651	" As Mrs. Fletcher did not tell a story with the Herodotean vivacity of Tim Badcock , I will render her facts in my own unpretending version , premising only that she had taken the farmer and Sally for specimens of the true Cockney ; a bit of saltatory reasoning of which she has not heard and perhaps never will hear the last . While then the worthy housekeeper was driving a slow but shrewd bargain , in a smart shop by the Broadway , taking the boots to the sunshine , to pick clever holes in the stitching , she observed a diminutive boy , of the genuine shoe - black order , encamping in a bight or back - eddy of pavement , just at the side of the door . This little fellow was uniformed , or rather multi - coloured , in gold , and red , and green . His cap was scarlet , and edged with gold twist ; his tunic red , and his apron of very bright green baize . On his cap , and on one shoulder , appeared his number , 32 , in figures of brass , an inch and a half in length . Strapped on his back he carried an oblong block of wood , like a great club - foot , and nearly as large as himself . This he deposited , with elaborate fuss , on the curb of the inner pavement , which terraced some inches above the true thoroughfare . A blacking - jar hung at one end of his block ; from a drawer below he pulled out three well - worn brushes , and began to hiss and to work away , in double quick time , with both hands , at some boot projected towards him on the delicate foot of fancy . As he grew warm at his work , with one sharp eye all the while looking out for a genial passenger , there slowly came straggling towards him a bevy quite fresh from Arcadia . First , in treble importance walked , impressively rolling and leering around , Hermes , Pan , and the owl of Pallas , combined in one Ebenezer Dawe . His eyes , never too co - operative , roved away upon either side , in quest of intelligence , which they received with a blink that meant , "
209854	210080	209429	209429	Gloucester	651	" With occasional jerks of his lank right arm , he was dragging along , like a saw through a knot , the sturdy , tight - buttoned , and close - pronged form of our little Jack . Jack was arrayed in a black wide - awake , with blue ribbons , and a bran - new suit of broad - furrowed corduroy , made of nights by his mother and Suke , and turned out with countless pockets , each having three broad buttons , to foil the London thieves . In one of these pockets , the trouser one I do believe , in spite of all Sally had taught him , he was now chinking , to the creak of the corduroys , his last - abiding halfpence , and lagging heavily on the poet 's arm , he cast fond glances at a pile of glorious peg - tops . Sticking her toes into little Jack 's heels , to kick anybody that dared to steal him , came my little Sally , all fire , and wonder , and self - assertion , towing her mighty father along , like a grasshopper leading an ox . At times she strove to drag him towards the finery of the windows , and paid very little heed to his placid protestations . "
210146	210181	210143	210143	I	0	" The farmer 's pockets were crammed with circulars , handbills , and puffs of every description , which he received from all who offered , and was saving them all for his wife . "
210189	210196	210143	210143	I	0	" cried a little shrill voice ; "
210272	210332	210333	210333	Zober	690	" The farmer pulled up suddenly , for fear of walking over him , as the boy , despising Beany Dawe , had dashed in between Jack and Sally , and danced before Mr. Huxtable . His brushes were whisking about , like bumble - bees roughly disturbed , and already menaced the drab of the Sunday fustian gaiters . "
210336	210372	210333	210333	Zober	690	" cried the farmer , who could not believe that he was addressed , having never dreamed , in his most ambitious moments if any such he had , of ever being called a gentleman , "
210413	210424	210403	210406	lat alo - un	4922	" - as the boy got more and more tentative - "
210470	210471	210465	210465	e	4923	" "
210525	210811	210486	210487	old bloke	4926	" The good farmer was lost beyond hope , in the multitude of subjects pressed all of a pulp on his slow understanding ; nevertheless , he had presence of mind to feel first for his watch and his money , and then for the best pocket - handkerchief stitched into the crown of his hat ; meanwhile the boy got hold of one foot , and began to turn up his gaiters . Then Sally and little Jack rushed to the rescue , and Jack punched the boy in the face , while Beany Dawe looked on with a grin of broad experience . But in spite of all aid , the farmer began to collapse before his mosquito enemy ; when luckily three giant Life - guards for a crowd was now collected opened their mouths , like the ends of a monkey - fur muff , in a round and loud guffaw , with a very coarse sneer at poor Sally . The farmer looked at them in much amazement ; then his perplexity went like a cloud , and his face shone with something to do , as he gave Sally his hat to hold . Till now all the mockers had been too small for him anyhow to fall foul of . Ere the echo of laughter was over , the three dandy Lifeguards lay on their backs in the mud , with their striped legs erect in the air , like the rods of a railway surveyor . The crowd fell back headlong , as if from a plunging horse , then laughed at the fallen and with the conqueror . Even the boy was humility multiplied into servility . "
210822	210831	210486	210487	old bloke	4926	" asked the farmer , replacing his hat ; "
210889	210898	210882	210882	e	4928	" - he remonstrated with the admiring multitude - "
210951	210970	210944	210944	her	4934	" These last two remarks were addressed to himself , but the crowd had full benefit of them . "
211053	211169	211172	211173	little chap	5830	" With bright ribbons fluttering and finery flapping about her , poor Sally knelt down in a moment to work at the muddy fustian : but her father would not allow it , he had only wished to try her ; so he caught her up with one hand , and kissed her , and I think , from what Mrs. Fletcher said , he must have given her sixpence at least . It is needless to say that , although the boy worked with both hands in the most conscientious manner , the farmer 's boots defied him . Neats'-foot oil , and tallow , and beeswax held their own against Day and Martin . "
211175	211182	211172	211173	little chap	5830	" said Mr. Huxtable , kindly , "
211249	211442	211443	211443	God	309	" In this little episode , as will be manifest , Sally has helped me more than Mrs. Fletcher . But now , to return to my narrative . Almost directly after the housekeeper left me , Patty came trotting in with a large white breakfast - cup full of most powerful tea . I can not help thinking that the little woman put some brandy in it , or allowed Mrs. Fletcher , who trusted much in that cordial , to do so ; but they stoutly deny the charge , and declare that there was only a pinch of gunpowder . Whatever it was , being parched with thirst , I swallowed without tasting it , and the effect upon my jaded brain was immediate and amazing . All self - pity was gone ; and self - admiration , and haughty courage succeeded . Was I , Clara Vaughan , who had groped and grubbed for years to find the hole of a blasting snake , and had now got my hand upon it , was I to start back and turn pale at his hiss , and say , "
211459	211695	211443	211443	God	309	" Would I not rather seize the incarnate devil , trample his spine , and make his tongue sputter in dust ? In a moment my cloak and hat were on again ; I scarcely looked at the glass , but felt the hot flush on my cheeks , as I lightly skipped down the stairs , and silently left the house . What to do next I knew not , nor asked , but flew headlong before the impulse , to lift and confront - as is my nature - the danger that lay before me . As I glided along , I was conscious of one thing , the people in the street turned in surprise to watch me . As if by instinct , I hurried straight to Lucas Street , my courage mounting higher and higher as I neared the accursed threshold . Balaam and Balak stood at the bar of a tavern which commanded a view of the street , but were much too busy with beer to see me passing so swiftly . Loudly I rang the bell of No . 37 ; the figures were bright on the door , and looking narrowly , I perceived the old No . 19 , more by the lines than the colour . Old Cora came as usual ; but started at seeing me , and turned as pale as death . "
211701	211710	211713	211713	Meesa	4942	" I could not use his false name . "
211722	211723	211719	211719	him	3150	" "
211733	211908	211719	211719	him	3150	" And I held my gordit before her . She cowered with one knee on the mat and kissed it ; then led me into the presence of Lepardo Della Croce . CHAPTER VIII . It was a dark and gloomy room , with three high , narrow windows . Cora departed hastily , frightened at what she had done . In a recess at the farther end , before a chest of black bog - oak , sat the man I sought . The crowning moment of my life was come . All rehearsals went for nothing : the strongest feeling of my heart was scorn , cold , unfathomable scorn . To show myself well , I took off my hat , and advanced in my haughtiest manner . As he turned his head , I saw that his mood was blacker than the oak before him . Some dark memorials perhaps were there ; hastily and heavily he flung down the lid , as I walked with even steps towards him . "
212002	212011	211999	212000	Miss Valence	435	" And he held out his delicate hand . "
212039	212187	212188	212188	You	4953	" He turned not pale , but livid . His jaunty nonsense was gone in a moment . He quailed from my dark eyes , and fell upon a chair . For one minute there he crouched , and dared not meet my gaze ; every fibre of his flesh was quivering . It was not shame that cowed him , but the prostration of amazement . Suddenly he leaped upright , and met me eye to eye . Then I saw that his pupils turned towards each other , as my uncle had described . I neither spoke , nor allowed my gaze to falter . Every nerve and cord of my frame was tense , and rigid , and rooted . To him I must have seemed the embodiment of revenge . At last he spoke , very slowly , and in words that trembled . "

212316	212317	212294	212301	The man you stole upon in his sleep	4958	" "
212320	212339	212294	212301	The man you stole upon in his sleep	4958	" His teeth struck together like fire - tongs badly jointed , and he could not part them . "
212367	212368	212358	212358	You	4953	" "
212372	212373	212358	212358	You	4953	" "

212583	212607	212580	212581	a Professor	4971	" I saw that my contempt was curling round him like a knout ; so I gave him a little more of it . "
212680	212728	212752	212754	Lepardo Della Croce	582	" A black tint darted beneath his skin , as if his heart were a cuttle - fish . Had I taken my eyes from him , he would have stabbed me . He fell back against the oak chest . My madness grew with my triumph . "
212802	212854	212795	212795	I	0	" Quietly I lay and watched him ; but as if he were scarcely worth it . He could not take his eyes from mine . He was like a rat before a snake . And all the while , his hand was working on the cross haft of a poniard . "
212873	212932	212865	212865	you	4953	" And I threw the window - hangings over the foot of the sofa , but so that I held him still in view . Calm as I was , I must have been mad to play with my life so contemptuously . Presently I rose , put back my hair and turned away , as in weariness . "
212993	213048	212988	212988	Rimbecco	564	" He sprang at me madly , gnashing his teeth , and whirling his stiletto . I faced him just in time , with both hands by my side . Had I raised them , or shown the least sign of fear , my life would have followed my father 's then and there . "
213051	213068	213108	213108	Rimbecco	564	" I said , while he paused , with the weapon not a yard from me , "
213111	213138	213108	213108	Rimbecco	564	" I saw in his eyes the flash which shows the momentum given , but his arm fell powerless . He looked even humbly at me . "
213142	213143	213139	213140	Clara Vaughan	300	" "
213152	213153	213139	213140	Clara Vaughan	300	" "
213171	213180	213181	213181	You	4953	" He tried to look piercingly at me . "

213296	213481	213287	213287	We	4979	" This seemed to amaze him more than all before . It was plain that he could not believe me . A long silence ensued . Looking at the wily wretch , I began unwittingly to compare , or rather to contrast his noble victim with him . I thought of the deep affliction and misery wrought by his despicable revenge . I thought of his brutal cruelty to the poor creatures God has given us ; and a rancour like his own began to move in my troubled heart . It had been there all the while , no doubt , but a larger pressure had stilled it . Watching me intently , he saw the change in my countenance , and as cold disdain grew flushed with anger , my power over him departed . But he did not let me perceive it . I am sure that I might have gone whither and when I pleased , and he would have feared to follow me , if I had only regarded him to the end with no other emotion than scorn . "
213487	213493	213483	213483	I	0	" he said at last , "

213711	213723	213707	213707	I	0	" A deep gleam shot through the darkness of his eyes . "

213759	213788	213744	213744	I	0	" With a shudder he glanced all round the room . Lily was not mistaken when she called him superstitious . Then he tried to sneer it off . "
213805	213817	213791	213793	the good Papa	4991	" Seeing that I disdained to answer , he continued thus : "
213883	214206	214212	214213	young lady	1992	" He raised the lid of the oaken chest , and propped it with a staple . Quite thrown off my guard for the moment , I began to devour the contents with my eyes . Not many things were in it ; but all of them were remarkable . To me they looked like theatrical properties , or materials for disguise . Some of them were faded and tarnished ; some were set with a silver cross . My gaze was rivetted on a pair of boots , fixed in a ledge with horse - shoe bays ; on the sole of one I perceived a cross of metal inlaid ; I drew nearer to see it more closely , when something fell over my head . All down me , and round me , and twisted behind in a tight tourniquet , before I could guess what it was . I am not weak , for a girl ; but I could no more lift my arms than a swathed mummy can . Neither could I kick , although as a child I had been famous for that accomplishment ; if I lifted either foot , I must tumble head - foremost into the box , which was large enough for me to live in . Scream I could , and did , in spite of all my valour , not only from fright , but from pain , for my chest was dreadfully tightened ; but before I could scream more than twice , a cloth was passed over my mouth , and knotted behind my neck . So there I stood , a helpless prisoner , in the recess at the end of the oaken ark . A low laugh thrilled in my ears , but the hand on my spine relaxed not ; I turned my neck by a violent effort and met the demon 's eyes . "
214295	214319	214284	214285	my child	1611	" Yes . Ignoble confession ! I , for whose disdain the world had been too small , was prisoned and helpless in an "
214324	214844	214284	214285	my child	1611	" like a fly in a paper cage - trap . The sofa , on which I had lain so grandly defying my enemy , was covered with a stout worsted net , long and very strong : this he had doubled end to end , and flung over my haughty head . I have not patience to recount his paltry , bantering jeers . Contempt is a tool I am used to grasp by the handle only . Be it enough to say that , without releasing me , he rang the bell for Cora , whose greedy eyes glistened when she saw my gordit loose from my bosom , and tangled in the net . Her master allowed her to disengage , and , for the time at least , appropriate it . In return for this , she was , at his pleasure , to stab me if he should order it . By his directions , she tied my ankles together , while he lashed my arms anew , and tightened the muffler over my bleeding lips . I closed my eyes , and prayed ; then I made up my mind to die , as many a Vaughan had done , at the hands of a brutal enemy . My last thought was of Conrad , and then my senses forsook me . CHAPTER IX . I have a faint recollection of feeling myself swung , and jolted down a number of stairs , and of a cold breeze striking on my face . And doubtless they carried me down ; for the room in which I had found my enemy was two floors above the cellarage . When I came to myself , I had no idea where in the world I was . The air was heavy with a most powerful and oppressive smell , a reek and taint as of death and corruption . It made me faint , and I think I must have gone off again . Lifting my head at last , I began to look languidly around . The table , or working - bench , on which I lay , was near the centre of a long and narrow room , gloomy and cold , even in the dog - days , floored with moss - green stone , and far below the ground - level . Those flag - stones , I suppose , were bedded immediately upon the tough blue London clay , that most unconquerable stratum , sullen , damp , and barren . I could only see two windows in the long low room , both upon the same side , horizontally fixed , and several feet from the floor . Heavy iron bars , perpendicularly set , crossed them at narrow intervals , as if it had been the condemned cell in a prison . One of these windows was already darkened with a truss of straw , and sacks over it , placed outside the glass ; as is done in Corsica , during Vendetta siege . The technical term is "
214849	215887	214284	214285	my child	1611	" Through the other window which looked up a slide or scoop of brickwork , like a malt - shovel , to the flabby garden behind the house , I saw an arm , the colour and shape of an American herring , very active with a hammer . I knew that arm at once . Sticking out at the joints , like the spurs of a pear - tree , welted and wired with muscle between them , like the drumstick of a turkey , but flat as if plaited of hide , no friend of mine could claim it , except the Corsican Cora . Deliberately she drove the nails , like a gardener training a tree , paying undue attention to her skinny knuckles ; then she lifted the sacks , stooped down and looked in , grimly reconnoitring me . By the slanting light I saw what a horrible place I lay in . Around and under me , on the furrowed timber , were dull plum - coloured blotches , where the slowly trickling blood of many an unlucky dog and cat had curdled ; even if there were not any shed from nobler veins . Reaching in a back - handed way towards the jagged margin , I grasped a cold hard cylinder . It was an iron hold - fast , like , but larger than the instrument to be seen in every carpenter 's bench , which works in a collared hole , and has a claw for clutching . Under it , no doubt , many a poor live victim had quivered and sobbed in vain . At my head were two square slides , fitted with straps of stout unyielding web . Near them was a rasped iron plane working along a metal bed or groove , with a solid T piece , and a winch to adjust it . As with morbid observation I surveyed these fiendish devices , and many others which I can not stop to tell of , I who love almost every creature made by our own Maker , especially those to whom we are lent as Gods , my flesh , I say , began to creep , and my blood to curdle , as if the dissecting knife were already in my diaphragm . Surely those who in full manhood torture His innocent creatures - poor things that can not plead or weep , but worship the foot that kicks them - surely these , if any , we may without presumption say that He who made will judge . Four brief lines by a modern poet , too well known for me to quote them , express a grand and simple truth , seldom denied , more seldom felt . But here am I , laid out in this fearful place , perhaps myself a subject for vivisection . No , I am not strapped ; even my feet are free . Off the grouted and grimy table I roll with all possible speed , the table where even strong Judy must have lain still as a skeleton . Of skeletons there were plenty ranged around the walls , and other hideous things which I can not bear to think of . One was a monstrous crocodile , with scales like a shed fir - cone , all reflexed and dry , and ringent lips of leather , and teeth that seemed to look the wrong way , like a daisy - rake over - worked . Another was some pulled - out beast , that never could hit his own joints again - plesiosauri , deinosauri , marsupials , proboscidians - I am sure I can not tell , having never been at college . I only know that at every one of them I shuddered , and shrugged my shoulders , and wished that he smelled rather nicer . Then there were numbers of things always going up and down , in stuff like clarified syrup , according to the change of temperature , just as leeches do in a pickle - bottle . Snakes as well , and other reptiles streaked like sticks of peppermint , and centipedes , and Rio wrigglers , called I think La Croya . It was enough in that vault - like room , which felt like the scooping of an August iceberg ; it was more than enough to strike a chill to the marrow , as of one who sleeps in a bed newly brought from the cellar . But the worst and most horrible thing of all was the core and nucleus of the smell that might be felt , the half - dissected body of a porpoise , leaning on a dozen stout cross - poles . It was enough to make the blood of a dog run cold . Overpowered by sights and smells , and the fear of mingling with them , I huddled away in a corner , and tried in vain to take my eyes from the only sign of life yet left , the motion of Cora 's club - like arm . The poor old woman enjoyed my interest in her work , and when she had finished , she made me a mock salaam , and kissed the pixie 's heart . Then , with a grin , she dropped the rough hangings , and left me in ghastly twilight . As the sacks fell over the window - frame , I lost all presence of mind , all honest indignation , everything but a coward horror , and the shrinking of life from death . With all the strength of my chest and throat , I cast forth , as a cannon discharges , one long , volleyed , agonising shriek . As it rang among the skeletons , and rattled their tissue - less joints , a small square grating in the upper panel of the heavy door swung back , and in the opening appeared the face of Lepardo Della Croce . He lifted his hat with a pleasant air , and addressed me with a smile , "
216466	216513	216458	216459	Miss Vaughan	300	" Through all this brutal sneering , I stood resolutely with my back turned to him . Perhaps he thought that I would stoop to supplication . I could have bitten my tongue off for that contemptible shriek ; it was such a triumph to him . "
216637	216638	216609	216609	you	300	" "
216653	216654	216643	216643	I	0	" "
216845	217591	216823	216823	you	300	" Taunting to the last , and sneering even at himself , as men of the blackest dye of wickedness are very apt to do , he closed the grating carefully , and I heard the ring of the metal cross on the rough stone steps . He had the boots of vengeance on ; his errand was stealthy and cold - blooded murder ; me , who had never harmed him , he was abandoning perhaps to death , certainly to madness - and yet to his own ideas , all he was doing was right . Frantic at the horrors around me , and still more so at those impending through my own rash folly , I tore and scratched at the solid door , and flung myself against it , till my nails were broken , and my fingers bleeding , and all my body palpitating with impotent mad fury . In weariness at last and shame at this wild outburst , I sat upon the floor , for I could not touch the operator 's stool , and tried to collect my thoughts . Was there any possibility of saving my poor Uncle ? It must now be nearly four o'clock on the Friday afternoon , or at least I so computed it . The beautiful watch given me by my Uncle had stopped through my reckless violence , and the breaking of the glass . The hands , as I could barely perceive , stood at a quarter to four . The express - train , by which Mrs. Fletcher and I were to have returned , would leave Paddington at five P.M. and reach Gloucester soon after eight . Lepardo Della Croce would catch it easily , and perhaps would accomplish his foul design that night . My only hope of preventing him lay in his own tenacity of usage . From my Uncle 's account , I knew , that on their cursed Vendetta enterprises , a certain pilgrimage on foot is , in many families , regarded as a matter of honour . This usage owes its origin perhaps to some faint trace of mercy , some wish to afford the evil passions one more chance of relenting to the milder reflections of weariness , and the influence of the air . Be that as it may , I believed that the custom was hereditary in the Della Croce family ; and if so , the enemy would finish his journey on foot , quitting the train some distance on this side of Gloucester . Therefore if I could contrive to escape in the course of the night , I might yet be in time . All the rest of the daylight , such as it was , I spent in examining , inch by inch , every part of the loathsome chamber , which was now my dungeon . By this time all my patience , habitual more than natural , had returned , and all my really inborn determination and hope . Surely I had been every bit as badly off before , and had struggled through quite as hopeless a difficulty . If arduous courage and tough perseverance were of any avail , those four walls should not hold me , though they might be three feet thick . So stopping both my nostrils with cotton - wool from a specimen for the smell was most insufferable , and pinning up my dress , I set to work in earnest . First , I examined the windows : there was nothing to hope from them ; I could never loosen a bar , and even if I could , I should only escape from one prison to another , for the garden behind the house was surrounded with high dead walls . Fireplace there was none ; the door had already baffled me ; could I dig through the party wall , and into the adjoining house ? Most likely it was all a falsehood and boast about the thickness , intended perhaps to discourage me from attempting the easiest way . And in so damp a place , the mortar probably would be soft . So , after searching and groping , ever so long , to find , if possible , one loose brick to begin with , I drew from my pocket a knife , of which I was very proud , "
217944	217948	217925	217925	She	596	" twopenny brick . "
217997	218035	217984	217986	the experienced dame	5031	" Surrender your legal right in Our Lady 's heart , without which I shall have no luck , and I will give you this beautiful fish , hard - roed , and done to a nicety . "
218142	218155	218130	218130	herself	596	" Now keep alive if possible till breakfast time , young woman , "
218284	218287	218280	218280	he	5036	" headers . "
219265	219273	219338	219338	I	0	" All the good in the world , "
219282	219333	219338	219338	I	0	" if you had shown sense enough , Clara , to fall to at that door , before your knife was broken , you might have cut through it by this time . Now you ca n't , that is certain ; but why should n't you burn it down ? "
220395	220399	220417	220423	a girl rather full in the chest	5051	" military heel . "
220550	220622	220623	220623	I	0	" Holy Madonna , most sacred mother , take back your blessed heart . Take it back , for the sake of the God that loved you , take it back , and trample on the wicked stomach of her who dared to steal it . You have come through the fires of hell to fetch it , mother of the beloved one , lo I hold it out to you . "
220738	220760	220733	220735	the little woman	2168	" Lor bless my soul , Miss Vaughan , where ever have you been ? Why , Mr. Chumps the butcher - "
220761	220790	220733	220735	the little woman	2168	" The bath in one moment , and all the water in the house . And as I throw my things out , burn them in the garden . "
221020	221041	221003	221003	she	421	" Yes , yes , Miss Vaughan . Quite right , my good friend ; not a moment to lose . "
221042	221057	221003	221003	she	421	" And pray , Mrs. Shelfer , where do you suppose we are going ? "
221058	221065	221068	221068	her	421	" Oh , I knows well enough "
221076	221108	221068	221068	her	421	" I knowed it all the time . Yes , yes . Let me alone for that . Patty Shelfer was n't born yesterday . Why only Tuesday was a week - "
221109	221120	221003	221003	she	421	" If you guess right , I will tell you . "
221121	221169	221003	221003	she	421	" Why going to Charley , Miss Vaughan , to be sure . Going for Charley 's opinion . And very wise of you too ; and what a most every one does ; particular when he have money . But how you knowed he were there - "
221170	221173	221068	221068	her	421	" Where ? "
221174	221225	221003	221003	she	421	" At the great wrestling match to be sure . And he wanted to take me ; a thing he ai n't offered to do fifteen year next oyster - day . No , no , says I , with Miss Vaughan away , and most likely among them resurrectioners - "
221327	221350	221321	221321	I	0	" And his grandfather were a sexton , Miss ; and our Charley himself a first - rate hand at the spade . "
221351	221517	221523	221523	she	5060	" Mrs. Shelfer , we are close to the place . Now , listen to what I say . It is not your husband I want , but Farmer Huxtable , whom you saw at the door . Nothing but a question of life and death would bring me among this rabble . No doubt there are many respectable men , but it is no place for a lady . The farmer himself knows that , and has never dared to ask me ; though his wife and daughter , in ignorance , have . It is half - past twelve exactly ; in a quarter of an hour at the utmost , I must speak to , and what is more , carry off the Devonshire competitor . Your husband is here , and on the Committee , you told me . I expect you to manage it . Go in at once and find him . Stop , here is plenty of money . "
221554	221592	221532	221532	she	5060	" Come back to me at once ; I shall not move from here . Mind , if the farmer loses the match through me , I will pay all , and give the money for another . "
221711	221776	221697	221697	He	424	" Very sorry indeed , Miss Vaughan , very sorry , you know . But we darrn't interrupt the men now . Our lives would n't be worth it , and they 'd kill both the umpires and the referee too you know . Why it 's fall for fall , only think of that , Miss Vaughan , it 's fall for fall ! "
221792	221798	221786	221786	he	424	" What do you mean ? "
221821	222061	222069	222070	Mr. Shelfer	424	" Why , the Great Northern won the first throw by a bit of foul play , a foul stroke altogether , and no back at all , say I , and my eyes is pretty good ; however , the umpires give it , and you should see John Huxtable 's face , the colour of a scythe - stone ; he knew it was unfair you know . And you should see him go in again for the second fall . ' I could ha dooed it , ' I hear him say , ' I could ha dooed it aisy , only I wudn't try Abraham , and I wun't nother if can help it now . ' None of us knows what he mean , but in he go again , Miss , and three times he throw Sam Richardson clean over his shoulder , and one as fair a back as ever was in sawdust . But the umpires would n't give it , till just now he turn him over straight for'ard , just the same as a sod in a spade , and they could n't get out of that . And now they be just in for the finishing bout , and if you want him , your only way is to come . May be , he 'll try Abraham , when he see you . Ah they 've catched . "
222947	223102	222940	222941	the farmer	5501	" Now , the latter watched his time , and his motive power waxed as the other 's waned . At length he lifted him bodily off his legs , and cast him flat on his back . A flat and perfectly level cast , as ever pancake crackled at . Thunders of applause broke forth , and scarcely could I keep quiet . With amazement the farmer espied me as he was bowing on all sides , and amid the tumult and uproar that shook the canvass like a lark 's wing , he ran across the ring full speed . Then he stopped short , remembering his laboured and unpresentable plight , and he would have blushed , if he had not been as red as fire already . None of such nonsense for me . I called him by name , took his hand , and with all my heart congratulated . "
223120	223142	223107	223107	I	0	" Beany Dawe and the children came , but I only stopped to kiss Sally , and motioned them all away . "
223185	223253	223258	223259	farmer Huxtable	344	" Mr. Huxtable looked astounded , and his understanding , unlike his legs , for the moment was carried away . Meanwhile up came Sally again , caught hold of my hand , and silently implored for some little notice , if only of her costume , violet , indigo , blue , green , yellow , orange and red . I could only kiss her again . "
223278	223279	223281	223281	you	344	" "
223296	223297	223300	223300	sir	5306	" "
223322	223406	223309	223310	the umpires	9197	" The man looked abased by his errand ; even he knew better . In my hurry I had paid no attention to the ominous hissing and hooting around a knot of men on the benches at the end . The farmer 's face I shall never forget ; as he slowly gathered the truth , it became majestic with honest indignation . A strong man 's wrath at deceit and foul play sat upon it , like a king on his throne . "
223411	223417	223309	223310	the umpires	9197	" he stammered at last - "
223454	223483	223452	223452	himself	5369	" Then , with all the power of his mighty voice he shouted , so that every fold of the canvass shook , and every heart thrilled fearfully : "
223635	223670	223617	223617	I	0	" Then , thorough gentleman as he was , he apologized to me for his honest anger , and for having drawn all eyes upon me , as there I stood at his side . "
223716	223757	223699	223699	They	5116	" Proudly he stepped into the ring again , and again the North Country giant , looking rather ashamed , confronted him . No fencing or feinting this time ; but the Devonshire wrestler , appealing thus to the public , "
223776	223894	223895	223895	I	0	" rushed straight at his antagonist , grappled him in some peculiar manner , seemed to get round his back , and then spun him up over his own left shoulder , in such a way that he twirled in the air and came down dead on his spine . Dead indeed he appeared to be , and a dozen surgeons came forward , in the midst of a horrible silence , and some were preparing to bleed him , when the farmer moved them aside ; he knew that the poor man was only stunned by concussion of the spine . Awhile he knelt over him sadly , with the tears in his own brave eyes : "
223987	224002	223982	223982	man	1548	" he leaped up , and tore it down , with very little respect , "
224115	224311	224315	224315	Miss	5418	" Perhaps he meant skirmish and manoeuvre , all in one . Sam Richardson , slowly recovering , put out his great hand , all white and clammy , and John Huxtable took it tenderly , amid such uproarious cheering , that I expected the tent on our heads . Even Shelfer 's sharp eyes had a drop of moisture in them . As for Beany Dawe , he flung to the winds all dithyrambic gravity , and chanted and danced incoherently , Cassandra and Chorus in one ; while Sally Huxtable blotted all her rainbow in heavy drops . Hundreds of pipes were smashed , even the Stoic Shelfer 's , in the rush to get at the farmer ; but he parted the crowd right and left , as I might part willow - sprays , and came at once to me . Whether by his aid , or by the sympathies of the multitude , I am sure I can not tell , but I found myself in a cab , with Sally at my side , and Mrs. Shelfer on the box , and the farmer 's face at the window . "
224385	224556	224375	224376	Jan Uxtable	349	" With thousands of people hurraing , we set off full gallop for Albert Street . CHAPTER XI . At the door we found Mrs. Fletcher just returned from Lady Cranberry 's , and eager to say a great deal which could not now be listened to . Having proved the speed of our horse , I begged the cabman to wait for a quarter of an hour , and then take us to Paddington at any fare he pleased , so long as he drove full gallop . This suited his views very nicely , and knowing Mr. Shelfer , as every one in London does - so at least I am forced to believe - he fain would have kept me ten minutes of the fifteen , to tell of Charley 's knowingness , how he had kept it all dark as could be , you see , Miss , and had won three hundred and twenty - five pounds , without reckoning the odd money , Miss - "
224564	224701	224561	224562	Mr. Cabman	705	" and I ran upstairs full speed , after telling Mrs. Shelfer the sum , lest she should be cheated . In five minutes I was ready , and came out of my bedroom into the sitting - room , with my hat in one hand , and a little bag in the other ; and there , instead of Mrs. Fletcher , I found , whom ? - Conrad ! Very pale and ill he looked , so unlike himself that I was shocked , and instead of leaping to him , fell upon a chair . He mistook me , and approached very slowly , but with his dear old smile : how my heart beat , how I longed to be in his arms ; but they looked too weak to hold me . "
224717	224718	224712	224712	you	0	" "
224764	224845	224759	224759	me	0	" But instead of my doing that , he had to do it for me ; for I was quite beaten at last , and fainted away in his arms . By this folly five minutes were lost ; and I had so much to say to him , and more to think of than twenty such heads could hold . But he seemed to think that it must be all right , so long as he had me there . "
224850	224859	224848	224848	Conny	676	" I said through my tears at last , "

224901	225008	224895	224895	I	0	" I could wait for no explanation , and he seemed inclined to give none . Perhaps this was the reason that he spent all the time in kissing me ; which , much as I enjoyed it , would have done quite as well at leisure . Be that as it may , there was no time to talk about it ; he said it did his lips good , and I believe it did , they were so pale at first , and now so fine a red . Suddenly in the midst of it , a great voice was heard from the passage : "
225022	225052	224895	224895	I	0	" Out I ran , with my hair down as usual , and a great flush in my cheeks , but I did not let any one see me . "
225089	225206	225086	225087	Mrs. Shelfer	405	" There was no time to consider it . The throat of hurry is large , and gulps almost any suggestion . Away we went full gallop ; the farmer was on the box , - how the driver found room I ca n't say , - Mrs. Fletcher and I inside , all consulting her watch every minute . Across the Regent 's Park , scattering the tame wild ducks , past Marylebone Church , and the Yorkshire Stingo , and Edgware Road - we saved it by just two minutes . Although I had taken his ticket , the farmer would not come with us , but went in a second - class carriage . "
225278	225349	225270	225270	I	0	" I knew that none ever could turn him from what he considered just , and therefore allowed him to ride where he pleased . But a dozen times I thought we should have lost him on the way ; for at every station , where the train stopped , he made a point of coming to our window , which he had marked with a piece of chalk , and "
225381	225461	225462	225463	Miss Vaughan'd	706	" Not fast enough for me , I told him every time ; whereupon he put on his hat with a sigh , and said he supposed I was born to it . And yet all the time he seemed to consider that he was protecting me somehow , and once he called me his dearie , to the great surprise of the other passengers , and the horror of Mrs. Fletcher ; seeing which he repented hastily , and "
225464	225621	225462	225463	Miss Vaughan'd	706	" me three times in a sentence , with a hot flush on his forehead . At Swindon , where we changed carriages , he pulled out very mysteriously from an inner breast - pocket a little sack tied with whipcord , and in which , I do believe , the simple soul had deposited all his hard - earned prize - money . Then he led us to the counter , proud to show that he had been there before , and earnestly begged for the honour of treating us to a drop of somewhat . His countenance fell so on my refusal , that I was fain to cancel it , and to drink at his expense a glass of iced sherry and water ; while Mrs. Fletcher , with much persuasion and simpering , and for the sake of her poor inside , that had been so long her enemy , ventured on a "
225628	225661	225462	225463	Miss Vaughan'd	706	" The farmer himself , much abashed at the splendour around him , which he told me , in a whisper , beat Pewter Will 's out and out , and even the "
225665	225899	225900	225900	Farmer	1681	" would not call for anything , until I insisted upon it ; being hard pressed he asked at last , hoping no offence of the lady , for a pint of second cider . The young woman turned up her nose , but I soon made her turn it down again , and fetch him , as the nearest thing , a bottle of sparkling perry . As always happens , when one is in a great hurry , the train was an hour behind its time , and the setting sun was casting gold upon the old cathedral - to my mind one of the lightest and grandest buildings in England , though the farmer prefers that squat and heavy Norman thing at Exeter - when we glided smoothly and swiftly into the Gloucester Station . I fully intended to have sent an electric message from London , not for the sake of the carriage , which mattered nothing , but to warn my dear uncle ; at Paddington , however , we found no time to do it , and so stupid I was that I never once thought of telegraphing from Swindon . To make up by over alacrity , in a case of far less importance , I went to the office at Gloucester , and sent this message to Tiverton , then the nearest Station to Exmoor - "
225915	226136	225909	225910	Clara Vaughan	300	" The amazement of the farmer , I can not stop to describe . No time was lost by doing this , for I had ordered a pair of horses , and they were being put to . Then , stimulating the driver , we dashed off for Vaughan St. Mary . Anxious as I was , and wretched at the thought of what we might find , so exhausted was my frame by the thaumatrope of the last six - and - thirty hours , that I fell fast asleep , and woke not until we came to the lodge . Old Whitehead came out , hat in hand , and whispered something into Mrs. Fletcher 's ear . That good old lady had been worrying me dreadfully about her jams , for the weather was so hot , she was sure all the fruit would be over , c. , none of which could I listen to now . As Whitehead spoke , I saw through my half - open lashes that she started violently ; but she would not tell me what it was , and I did not want to intrude on secrets that might be between them . The farmer also diverted attention by calling from the box , as we wound into the avenue , "
226198	226327	226194	226194	you	6186	" I do believe those men of Devon see nothing they admire , without thinking at once of their county . At the front door , the butler met us , which surprised me rather , as being below his dignity . He was a trusty old servant , who had been under Thomas Henwood , and had come back to his place since the general turn - out of the household . Now he looked very grave and sad , and instead of leading me on , drew me aside in the hall . It was getting dark , and the fire in the west was dying . Great plumes of asparagus - shame it was to cut them - waved under the ancient mantel - piece . "
226335	226345	226351	226351	Miss.	358	" - they all seemed to call me that - "
226361	226362	226365	226365	you	0	" "
226368	226369	226365	226365	you	0	" "
226382	226383	226374	226374	you	300	" "
226396	226405	226392	226392	you	300	" - I could not finish the sentence . "
226933	226956	226958	226958	he	5306	" Ah , John Hoxton , did you say that to him , I wonder , or interpolate , ex post facto ? "
227153	227154	227135	227135	she	677	" "
227168	227169	227157	227157	He	0	" "
227229	227442	227215	227215	She	677	" I went straightway to the poor little dear , without even stopping to read the letter placed in my hands . The room in which she lay was dark ; for Jane , who was watching in my little parlour , whispered to me that the poor child could not bear the lamp - light , her eyes were so weak and sore . At first Lily did not know me ; and it went to my heart , after all my own great sorrows , to hear the sad low moaning . She lay on my own little bed , with her pale face turned to the wall , her thick hair all over her shoulders , and both hands pressed to her heart . Annie Franks had been many times to ask for her , but Lily would not let her come in . Bending over I laid my cheek on Lily 's , and softly whispered her name . At last she knew me , and took my hand , and turned her sweet lips to kiss me . Then she sobbed and cried most bitterly ; but I saw that it did her good . By and by she said , with her fingers among my hair : "
227474	227475	227479	227480	my pet	5379	" "
227526	227527	227496	227496	you	5379	" "
227538	227553	227556	227556	you	5379	" And her lovely young form trembled , at the thought of visiting death . "
227613	227634	227605	227605	I	0	" God knows that I spoke so , not from harshness , only in the hope to do her good . "
227646	227647	227636	227636	you	5379	" "
227669	227670	227658	227658	He	5191	" "
227724	227725	227710	227710	He	5191	" "
227734	227735	227726	227726	Conny	676	" "
227744	227892	227739	227739	I	0	" and a bright flash of joy shone forth from the eyes that were red with weeping . Something cold pushed quietly in between us , and then gave a sniff and a sigh . It was darling Judy 's nose . He had learned in the lower regions , where he always dwelled in my absence , that Miss Clara was come home ; and knowing my name as well as his own , he had set off at once in quest of me . After offering me his best love and respects , with the tip of his tongue , as he always did , he looked from one to the other of us , with his eyebrows raised in surprise , and the deepest sorrow and sympathy in his beautiful soft - brown pupils . I declare it made us cry more than ever . "
227897	227903	227904	227904	he	5199	" sobbed Lily at length , "
227920	227945	227912	227912	you	300	" His eyes dropped , as she was telling me . They always did , when he thought he had been a bad dog . "
227970	227990	227961	227965	A great friend of mine	6938	" Away he trotted obediently , and his tail recovered its flourish before he had got to the corner . "
228000	228009	227993	227993	darling	2159	" said the poor child , trembling again . "
228017	228823	228015	228015	you	2159	" Hand in hand we walked into my Uncle 's chamber . Young as I was , and still thoughtless in many ways , twice before now had I gazed on the solemn face of death ; but never , not even in my mother 's holy countenance , saw I such perfect peace and bliss as dwelt in and seemed to smile from my dearest Uncle 's lineaments . The life , in youth puffed here and there by every captious breeze of pride , in its prime becalmed awhile on the halycon deep of love , then tempest - tossed through the lonely dark , and shattered of late by blows from God , that life whose flaw of misanthropy and waste of high abilities had been redeemed , ennobled even , by a pure and perfect love - now it had bidden farewell to all below the clouds , calmly , happily , best of all - in faith . We knelt beside the bed and prayed - Lily as a Catholic , Clara as a Protestant - that we , and all we loved , might have so blest an end . Then we both sat peacefully , with a happy awe upon us , in the dark recess behind the velvet curtains . Two wax candles were burning on the table towards the door , and by their light the face we loved , looked not wan , but glorious , as with a silver glory . Clasping each the other 's waist , and kissing away each other 's tranquil tears , how long we sat there I know not , neither what high fluttering thoughts , thoughts or angels , which be they - stealthily a door was opened , not the door of heaven , not even the main door of the room we sat in , but a narrow side - door . Through it crept , with crawling caution , he whom most of all men I now despised and pitied . Lily did not hear his entrance , neither did she see him ; but my eyes and ears were keen from many a call of danger . Stunned for a while by the heavy blow , that met me on my return , I had forgotten all about him ; I mean , at least , all about his present design . I had indeed told the farmer , for it was only fair to do so , my object in bringing him down ; and how I relied on his wonderful strength and courage , having then no other to help me ; but since I got home , and heard the sad tidings , it seemed a mere thing for contempt . Not even Lepardo Della Croce could catch a departed spirit . So , and in the landslip of the mind , sapped by its own , and sliding swiftly into another 's sorrow , I had not even ordered that the house should be watched at all ; I had not even posted Giudice , who had a vendetta of his own , anywhere on guard . With a stiletto still concealed , all but the handle on which the light fell , he approached the bed , wriggling along and crouching , as a cat or leopard would . Then he rose and stood upright at the side of the bed , not our side but the other , and glared upon his intended victim 's face . I pushed Lily back behind the curtain as if with the weight of my bosom , while I watched the whole . Never in all my tempestuous life , of all the horrible things I have seen , and heard , and shuddered at , saw I anything so awful , so utterly beyond not only description , but conception , as that disdainful , arrogant face , when the truth burst on him . Not the body only , but the mind and soul - if God had cursed him with one - were smitten back all of a lump , as if he had leaped from a train at full speed into a firing cannon 's mouth . Before he had time to recover , I advanced and faced him . All dressed in white I was , with my black hair below my waist , for I had thrown off my travelling frock , and taken what first came to hand . They tell me I look best in white , it shows my hair and eyes so . He believed that it was a spirit , the Vendetta spirit of the other side ; and he cowered from me . I was the first to speak . "
228891	229290	228879	228881	a vindictive foe	5207	" I led the way , trembling at every corner lest we should meet Giudice ; for I knew he would not obey me , if he once caught sight of this hated one . After standing silently , unable to take his eyes from the placid face of the dead , Lepardo began to follow me , walking as if in a dream . Meeting none , I led him forth along the corridor , down the end staircase , and out on the eastern terrace . There I waved him off , and pointed to the dark refuge of the shrubbery , beyond the mineral spring . The moonlight slept upon the black water narrowly threading the grass . Over our heads drooped the ivy , the creeper of oblivion . The murderer turned and looked at me ; hitherto he had glided along with his head down , as in bewilderment . Oh that he had said one word of sorrow or repentance ! He spoke not at all ; but shuddered , as the ivy rustled above us . His face was pale as the moonlight . Did he see in me something higher than the spirit of Vendetta ? I pointed again to the trees , and urged him away from the house . He had two strong enemies there ; a minute might make all the difference . Breaking as if from a spell , he waved his Italian cap , and his lithe strong figure was lost among the Portugal laurels . For a minute I stood there , wondering ; then slowly went round the house - corner , and gazed at the grey stone mullions of the room which had been my father 's . I was still in the anguish of doubt and misgiving - what right had an ignorant girl like me to play judge and jury , or more , to absolve and release a crime against all humanity ? - when a mighty form stood beside me , and Giudice , all bristle and fire , dashed forth from the door in the gable . With command and entreaty I called him , but he heard me not , neither looked at me ; but scoured the ground like a shadow , quartering it as a pointer does , only he carried his nose down . "
229296	229301	228879	228881	a vindictive foe	5207	" said the farmer , "
229321	229322	229310	229310	I	0	" "
229342	229343	229334	229334	He	5208	" "
229401	229713	229395	229397	the girt dog	5213	" As the dog found the track and gave tongue , the farmer rushed from me and followed him , dashing headlong into the shrubbery , after leaping the mineral spring , at the very spot where the footprints had been . Judy and Farmer Huxtable were fast friends already ; for that dog always made up his mind in a moment on the question of like and dislike . For a time I was so horror - struck , that no power of motion was left . I knew that the farmer was quite unarmed , he carried not even a stick . Even with the great dog to help him , what could he do against fire - arms , which Lepardo was sure to have ? What should I say to his wife and children , what should I say to myself , if John Huxtable fell a victim to that wily and desperate criminal ? Resolved to be present , if possible , I rushed down the narrow path which led to the little park - gate , where probably they would pass . I was right : they had passed , and flung it wide open . Breathless I looked around , for hence several tracks diverged . No living thing could I see or hear , but the beating of my heart , which seemed to be in my throat , and the hooting of an owl from the hollow elm at the corner . I flung myself down on the dewy grass , and strained my eyes in vain ; until by some silver birch - trees on which the moonlight was glancing , I saw first a gliding figure that looked like a deer in the distance , then a tall man running rapidly . Away I made by a short cut for the "
229718	229902	229395	229397	the girt dog	5213	" as the end of the lake was called , for I knew that the path they were on led thither . Quite out of breath I was , for I had run more than half a mile , when I came full upon a scene , which would have robbed me of breath if I had any . At the end of a little dingle , under a willow - tree , and within a few feet of the water , stood Lepardo Della Croce , brought to bay at last . A few yards from him , Giudice was struggling furiously to escape the farmer 's grasp ; perhaps no other hand in England could have held him . His eyes kindled in the moonlight , like the red stars of a rocket , and a deep roar of baffled rage came from the surge of his chest , as he champed his monstrous fangs , and volleyed all the spring of his loins . The farmer leaned backward to hold him , and stayed himself by a tree - stump . "
229961	229975	229953	229953	I	0	" Lepardo answered calmly , in a voice that made my blood cold : "
230003	230057	229991	229991	I	0	" I saw the barrel of a large revolver , with a stream of light upon it . He held it steadily as a tobacco - pipe . I am glad he owned some courage . For my life , I could not stir . All the breath in my body was gone . "
230069	230076	230062	230063	Thiccy man	5219	" said the farmer quite contemplatively . "
230160	230189	230155	230155	Ston	709	" And the farmer approached him coolly , trailing the dog along ; as if what the murderer held in his hand was a stick of Spanish liquorice . "
230206	230207	230190	230190	Fool	5223	" "
230211	230216	230190	230190	Fool	5223	" said the farmer , "
230324	230342	230343	230343	Fool	5223	" And the farmer buried his right hand in his capacious trowsery . The Corsican seemed astonished . "
230367	230427	230428	230429	Great God	5232	" Out blazed the pistol with a loud ring , and I saw that the farmer was struck . He let go the dog , and leaped up ; his right hand fell on Lepardo 's temple , and seemed to crush the skull in , - another shot at the same instant and down fell the farmer heavily . "
230431	230644	230428	230429	Great God	5232	" I screamed , and leaped forward . But Giudice was loose to avenge him , though I could swear that it was on a corpse . Corpse or living body , over and over it rolled , with the dog 's fangs in its throat . I heard a gurgle , a tearing , and grinding , and then a loud splash in the water . The dog , and the murderer , both of man and dog , sunk in the lake together . Twenty feet out from the shore rose above water one moment , drawn ghastly white in the moonbeams , the last view seen till the judgment - day of the face of Lepardo Della Croce . Almost drowned himself - for he would not release his father 's murderer , while a gasp was in him - staggered at last to the shore my noble and true dog Giudice . He fell down awhile , to recover his breath , then shook himself gratefully , tottered to me , where I knelt at the farmer 's side , and wagged his tail for approval . The water from his chest and stomach dripped on the farmer 's upturned face , and for a moment revived him . "
230707	230884	230702	230702	Beany	340	" And his head fell back on my lap , and I felt sure that he was dead . How I screamed and shrieked , till I lay beside him , with Judy licking my face , none can tell but the gamekeepers , who had heard the shots , and came hurrying . Of this lower end of the lake they happened to be most jealous ; for a brood of pintail ducks , very rare I believe in England , had been hatched here this summer , and no one was allowed to go near them . Poor Judy kept all the men aloof , till I was able to speak to him . Then I perceived that he as well was bleeding , wounded perhaps by the poniard as he leaped on his enemy 's breast . It had entered just under the shoulder , and narrowly missed the heart . They took us at once towards the house , carrying the farmer and Judy on the wooden floodgates of the stream called the "
230889	231065	230702	230702	Beany	340	" which here fell into the lake . As we entered the avenue , being obliged to take the broad way , though much further round , we heard a carriage coming . It was the one I had sent for Conrad , with a hurried note to break the sad news of his father 's death . He had been detained in London by a challenge he found from Lepardo ; which was of course a stratagem to keep him out of the way . How delighted I was to see his calm brave face again , as he leaped down , and took my tottering form in his arms . In a minute he understood everything , and knew what was best to be done . He would not allow them to place the poor farmer in the carriage , as they foolishly wanted to do ; but laid the rude litter down , examined the wounds by the lamplight , and bound them up most cleverly with the appliances of the moment . "
231074	231075	231068	231068	Conrad	676	" "
231098	231099	231100	231100	I	0	" "
231111	231112	231104	231104	you	0	" "
231180	231272	231173	231174	Poor Judy	710	" Thus Conrad saw for the first time the hearth and home of his ancestors , with his father lying dead there , and his avenger carried helpless . But I met him at the door . Did that comfort you just a little , my darling ? CHAPTER XII . The lake was dragged that night , and all the following day , in spite of the gamekeeper 's strong remonstrance for the sake of the tender pintails . But nothing whatever was found , except the Italian cap . The "
231277	231693	231173	231174	Poor Judy	710	" invisible I am glad to say from the house , is more than forty feet deep , when the water is at its lowest . Three or four years afterwards young William Hiatt caught a monstrous pike in the lake , and sent him , with our permission , to be stuffed at Gloucester . Like the famous fish of Samos , this pike had swallowed a ring , which was sent to Conrad by the Gloucester gun - maker . It was Lepardo 's seal - ring , the cross of the family engraved on a bloodstone , with L.D.C. below it . Whether the midnight stabber died by the blow of an English fist , or suffered vivisection through a dog 's vendetta - an institution more excusable and dignified than man 's - is known to Him , and Him alone , who holds the scales of retribution , and laughs in scorn as well as wrath at our attempts to swing them . For are we not therein ourselves ; and how shall the best and strongest of us carry the thing he is carried in ? Right glad I am , and ever shall be , that I moved not in the awful scene , which closed my father 's tragedy . Through Conrad 's skill and presence of mind , the dear farmer 's life was saved . We sent to Gloucester immediately for the cleverest surgeon there ; and he owned that he could not have fixed the ligatures better , though he did what Conny durst not attempt , he extracted the murderer 's bullet . It was the first shot that did all the mischief , being aimed deliberately at the large and tender heart . Thanks to the waving of the willow - tree , for Lepardo was a known marksman , it had missed by about two inches . The second shot , fired quite close and wildly , had grooved the left temple , and stricken the farmer senseless . For six weeks now our dear friend , whose patience amazed all but me , was kept from his Devonshire home . To London I sent at once for the two children and Mr. Dawe , and would have sent to Devon as well , for kind and good Mrs. Huxtable , but her husband would not hear of it . By Ann Maples , who had left Lady Cranberry ' shockingly , "
231711	231839	231706	231706	he	5246	" kind love and best duty , and for goodness ' sake , stop at home now . No call to make a fule of yourself , and the farm go to rack and ruin . There be fuss enough 'bout I already , and never I brag no more , when a pill like thiccy upsot me . But Miss Clara , God bless her bootiful eyes , she nurse me , just as if she wor my own darter , with the apron on as you give her . And you should see the kitchen , Honor , you loves a kitchen so ; they be a bilin and roastin arl day , and they be vorced to swape the chimbley three times in a vortnight "
231855	231857	231885	231886	the surgeon	5612	" vorced "
231959	232390	231941	231941	his	3106	" Yes , my dear child , the close of my wasted and weary life . You may be surprised and perplexed at what I am about to tell you ; but you are not one of those low - minded ones , who condemn as superstition all beyond their philosophy . The very night after you brought me my new Lily , a sweet thing just like her mother , I lay for some hours awake , broad awake as I am now . I was thinking of my two Lilies , the lovely and loving creatures . I was not in the least excited , but calm , reflective , and happy . Soon after the clock struck two , at the time when our life burns lowest , I heard a soft voice , sweet as the music of heaven , call me by name three times . Of course I knew whose it was : too often that voice had murmured upon my bosom , for me not to know it now . Not rashly , but with a mind long since resolved , I answered : ' Sweetest mine ' - her own artless and young endearment - ' Sweetest mine , no longer will I keep you lonely . ' No answer came in words ; but the light , the golden light of my own love 's smile , as I had seen it in Corsica , when she came from the grave to comfort me . And now , as after that visit , I fell into deep and perfect rest , such rest as comes but rarely until the sleep of all . No wonder you and Lily thought me so strong next day . In the morning I knew and rejoiced in my quick departure . This cold obstruction was to be cast aside , this palsied frame to release the winged soul . On the third day I was to find and dwell with my Lily for ever . So on the first day I enjoyed the harmless pleasures of life , and could not bear you to leave me , because that would have turned them to pain . The second day I got through all the business that still remained , refreshing its dryness often with my sweet child 's society . On this , the third , I write to you , and am , through the grace of God , as calm and content , nay more content than if I were going to bed . "
232651	232684	232649	232649	hers	677	" Not only did we look upon his last fond wish as sacred , but we accomplished it in the manner that was likely to please him most . We put his own "
232687	232905	232649	232649	hers	677	" the little love - boat as they called it , into commission again , engaged a good captain and crew , and taking old Cora with us , set sail from Gloucester for the Mediterranean . Poor Cora was now all devotion to Conrad and Lily , ever since she had found that they were lawful blood and direct heirs of the Della Croce . The more recent part of the family story she had known only from her master 's version , and had set little store by the children as bearing the stamp of disgrace ; though she could not help loving sweet Lily . Now , by her evidence , coupled with my dear Uncle 's deposition , his relics , and documents , and my own testimony , confirmed by Balaam and Balak , we established very easily the birth and the claims of my Uncle Edgar 's children ; and the old Count Gaffori , most venerable of signors , would have kept us a month at least to go through all his accounts . He was entreated to retain his position as the guardian of our Lily . So far as our recent sorrow permitted enjoyment of scenery , we were all enchanted with the Balagna . At the funeral of "
232909	233593	233594	233594	Lucus	715	" whose name was still remembered and loved , nearly all the commune was present ; and many a dignified matron shed tears , who had smiled as a graceful girl , and strown flowers , at his wedding . They were burning with curiosity to see our beautiful Lily , for the tender tale had moved them , as Southern natures are moved ; and many of them had loved and gloried in her mother . But in spite of all this desire , not a prying glance fell on her , as she bowed in the hooded robe , and wept to the mournful vocero . Foremost of all stood old Petro and Marcantonia , who had found out and kissed with sobs of delight their beloved master 's daughter . For my part , I loved the Corsicans ; there is something so noble and simple about the men , so graceful , warm - hearted , and lady - like in the women ; and in a very short time I could understand more than half they said . The black Vendetta , they told me , was dying out among them , and in a few years would be but a wonder of the past . God in His mercy grant it . There must have been something surely in my Uncle Edgar 's nature , which won the Southern hearts , as my father won British affections . Such things I can not explain , or account for . I only know and feel them . We were all back at Vaughan St. Mary before the end of August , and found the farmer , the two chillers , and Beany Dawe as happy as if they were born and reared there . Old Cora was left at Veduta Tower ; and having obtained Mr. Dawe 's permission I presented her once and for all with the whole treasure of the gordit . She intends , however , to bequeath it to me in her will . Soon afterwards Conrad gave her a more substantial blessing ; for he sold the things left in Lucas Street , under letters of administration , as being the next of kin . All the proceeds he handed over to Cora , except one - tenth , which he presented to the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals . As many of the specimens , iguanodon , and other monsters , fetched prices as hard to explain away as themselves , poor Cora was amply provided for : all which of course she attributed to the holy Madonna 's heart . And now at last I understood how 19 , Grove Street had become No . 37 , Lucas Street . The change of number I have already explained ; the change of name was on this wise : - The builder , a rising man , who had bought the old part of the street , and built thereto the new one , had a son , a fine undergraduate , better skilled in the boats than in the books of Oxford . Reading hard one day , after his third pluck , this young man discovered that lucus was the Latin for grove . He smote his hand on his forehead , and a great idea presented itself . Had there not been both nymphs and philosophers of the grove ? The street that was his inheritance should be distinguished by nomenclature from the thousand groves of London , wherein the nightingale pipeth not , neither - but I am getting poetical , and do n't understand the Gradus . Enough , that he wrote at once and earnestly to his father , forgetting the vivid description , which was now growing stale , of his pluck - a result secured , as the Winchester gentlemen tell me , by learning too solid to carry - but begging that his Oxford career might at least be commemorated in and by the street that paid his bills there . "
233595	233612	232649	232649	hers	677	" he wrote plainly enough , and in very large letters , but the father read it "
233615	233637	232649	232649	hers	677	" No , said the mother , she was sure Alexander never meant such a low thing as that , it was "
233639	233682	232649	232649	hers	677	" of course ; why the Lucases were her own cousins , and Rosa such a nice girl , she saw how it was , that she did , and Alexander might have done worse . And so it was painted most bravely "
233686	233847	232649	232649	hers	677	" and the builder was n't going to make a fool of himself , when Alexander protested . When John Huxtable set off for home , just in time to see to his harvest , which is always late round Exmoor , I kissed him - ay , Conny , you saw it - and thrust , during his amazement , something far down into his mighty pocket , which something he was not upon any account to look at until he got home . It was a deed , prepared by our solicitors , presenting him with the fee simple of Tossil 's Barton farm . True , I was not of age , but I signed it as if I had been , and Conny and I again signed it , when we paid our first visit there . Perhaps , in strict law , it binds not my interest even now ; but if ever any one claiming "
233860	234012	233638	233638	Lucas	716	" me , forgets the Vaughan honour and dares to dream of that farm , I 'll be at him as sure as a ghost ; and I trust before that time comes , the farmer will have sound title by immemorial years of possession . He is now a prosperous man ; and has never found it necessary to give up his beer , as he threatened Young John , who is just like his father , cleaves fast to Tabby Badcock , now a blooming maiden ; but my Sally has more than balanced that imminent loss of caste , by fixing the eyes and transfixing the heart of George Tamlin , the son of our principal tenant , and himself of Devonshire origin . The young lady comes to and fro every six weeks , and is to be married from our house , when her father considers her "
234016	234283	233638	233638	Lucas	716	" Beany Dawe , who does not like work , still lives at Tossil 's Barton , and is in receipt of a pension of sixpence a day from Government , as a bard at last appreciated . As for me , Clara Vaughan , on the very day after that which released me from my teens counting forward , as we do , till we count receding years , to wit on the 31st of December , 1851 , I did not change my name , but wrote it in the old church register , half an inch below a better and firmer hand . There was no fuss or frippery ; no four clergymen and ten bridesmaids simpering at one another . Our good vicar represented the one class , dear Lily and Annie Franks the other . My godfather , newly disclosed for the purpose , gave me away very gracefully , and young Peter Green helped Conrad . Lily Vaughan looked so exquisite , so deliciously lovely , that nobody in the whole world - Now Conny , hold your tongue , I never fish for compliments , do n't degrade yourself so for a kiss , of course I know all my perfections , but how can I care about them , when you say they belong to you ? - Lily Vaughan , I say once more , was such a sunrise of loveliness , that young Peter Green , just new from his Oxford honours , collapsed , and fell over the railings , and wedged his head in the "
234286	234523	233638	233638	Lucas	716	" or whatever those nice young gentlemen , who see the duty of wearing strait waistcoats , are pleased to denominate it . Ah , Little Distaff Lane , most unconnubial title , ah firm of Green , Vowler , and Green , your Hercules holds the distaff , and holds it , alas , in his heart ! From that shock he never recovered , until we had at Vaughan Park a really merry wedding ; and I , ah me , I could not dance just then , but I showered roses upon them , for the shadow of death was past . Old Mr. Green , - nay , nay , not fifty yet , by our Lady , - Mr. Peter Green the elder , came down here for the occasion , and I hardly ever took such a fancy to any man before . He seemed to know almost everything , not by the skin , as Dr. Ross seemed to hold things , but by the marrow and fibrine of their alimentary part . And withal such a perfect gentleman : he kept in the horns of his knowledge , instead of exalting them , and making us wish for hay on them , while tossed in headlong ignorance . Scant as I am of space , I must tell how he behaved , when his son revealed his attachment . "

234542	234543	234537	234537	she	1694	" "

234629	234760	234761	234762	Clara Green	721	" Having behaved so nobly , for this boy was his only hope , he deserved to find , as he did , that if he had searched the world he could not have hit upon any other so desirable for his son , as the daughter of his old friend . The only mistake he has made is that he so adores her , he can not bear her to be in Corsica ; though the trade they conduct is worth at least fifty thousand a year . When Lily fell in love , I told her that it was because she had an eye for the olives ; and olives enough the darling has , I trow , and olive branches too . The eldest is called Clara . "
234764	235064	234761	234762	Clara Green	721	" I do n't like the sound altogether ; but the substance is something beautiful , and the freshest of all Spring verdure . Nevertheless , my Clara is an inch larger round the calf , and I think her eyelashes are longer . Her hair weighs more , that is certain . We compare them very often ; for they live only half the year at Veduta Tower . In the summer heats they are here , and the children between them , my own every bit as bad , leave dear Annie Elton Annie Franks of old , uncommonly few British Queens . It is all Mr. Shelfer 's fault . What is the use of a gardener , if he allows dessert all the day long ? Every autumn we go to Corsica to help at the olive harvest , and rarely we enjoy it . The Old Veduta Tower is like a nest in the ivy , chirruping with young voices ; and the happy sleep of the two who loved so well is dreaming , if dream it can or care to do , of the fairest flowers in Europe , scattered there by little soft hands . Conny is wild every time about the Rogliano and Luri ; and if Peter Green listens to him - which every one does , except me - he will introduce , very slowly of course , those fine - bodied yet aerial wines to the noble British public , that loves not even intoxication , unless it be adulterated . Oh , queer Mrs. Shelfer , oh Balaam and Balak , shall I pretermit your annals ? The two Sheriff 's officers , having secured their reward , set up therewith a public - house called the "
235069	235139	234761	234762	Clara Green	721	" which soon became the head quarters of all who are agents or patients in the machinery of levying . As at such times all people drink and pay more than double , the public - house has already a Queensbench - ful of good - will . Poor Mrs. Shelfer and Charley did not invest the 325 l. altogether judiciously : at least , it went mainly to purchase "
235143	235191	234761	234762	Clara Green	721	" whose time does not begin to run till the purchaser 's is over . But Patty , I am glad to say , has still that 30 l. a year of her own , left to her in the funds by good and grateful Miss Minto . "
235238	235348	234761	234762	Clara Green	721	" Be this as it may , what is much more to the purpose is that Mr. Shelfer can not touch it . And now I have pride in announcing , for I never expected such glory , that all the cats and birds , squirrels , mice , and monkeys , live , like the happy family , in our northern lodge , where Patty is most useful and happy as the Queen of the poultry . In a word , they keep the gate , not of their enemies , but of old and grateful friends . I expected to see at least a leading article in the "
235351	235481	234761	234762	Clara Green	721	" when Mr. Shelfer left the metropolis ; but they let him go very easily for the sake of the discount market . They gave him only two - and - twenty dinners ; but when he first came to Vaughan Park , how he wanted country air ! Now he attends to the wall - trees , and the avenue , and I hope finds harmony there . At any rate , he never breaks it by any undue exertion . Nevertheless , his very long pipe is of some account with the green fly , which has been very bad on our peaches , ever since they repealed the corn laws . Mr. Shelfer , accordingly , is compelled to spend half his time in smoking them . "
235519	235520	235503	235503	Miss	5279	" "

235648	235701	235640	235640	they	5278	" Patty brought all her sticks of course , in spite of the twenty - five bills of sale , which by this time had grown upon them . One whole roomful was packed in the duplicate inventories . The law on this subject she contemplated from a peculiar point of view . "

236119	236315	236316	236317	Miss Clara	300	" When Uncle John appeared , he scolded me for my want of intelligence on the night when I was blinded . Of the four men in that room , the one whom I had noticed least was the very one whom he had meant me especially to observe . At least , so he said ; but I fully believed , and did not scruple to tell him , that he had discovered little beyond the information and description given at the time by Mr. Edgar Vaughan . These he had disinterred from the archives of Bow Street and Whitehall , and was then trying to apply them . However , I forgave him freely ; inasmuch as , but for my blindness , even blind love would have known me as an objectionable being . And now I come to a real grievance . When there is another Miss Clara - such a beauty ! I ca n't tell you - and a little Harry , for whose sake this tale is told - why will every one on these premises , even the under - gardener 's boy , persist in calling me "
236319	236422	236316	236317	Miss Clara	300	" It makes me stamp sometimes , and such a bad example that is for my children . Dear me , if either of my ducklings were to carry on as I did at their age , I would cut down immediately the largest birch - tree on the property , and order a hogshead of salt . But , to return to that contumely - is it to be suspected that I was more forcible and pronounced , in the days of my trial and misery , than now when I am the happiest of all the young mothers of England ?
